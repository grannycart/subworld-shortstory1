# 10k-word short story notes

## Initial notes
* 10k words
* free story on Amazon as a promo/loss leader
* If you enjoy this story, here are 3 ways you can support this work:
	1. Pass it on! It's free. The audience that enjoys this kind of story is very particular and hard to reach. You can help by giving it to a friend or enemy who you think would like it.
	2. Join the mailing list. This is the most important thing you can do if you like someone's creative work. A mailing list is like a concrete fanbase that is controlled by the creator instead of some corporate overlord. You should get on the mailing list of anyone whose work you admire (as long as they don't abuse your trust by sending lots of spam). Speaking of which, fear not the spam! This is a friends and family thing, blah blah blah. You can sign up here (github page/google form something) or email me directly and ask to be added: blah@protonmail.com
	3. Buy a book: link-to-purchase-page.com; compelling description of book contents.
* cover:
	* one possibility: type up the first couple of pages, then approximate a stack that would hold the whole story;
		* Or just do the whole first full draft as a typed document --- as you planned to do for book 2. No reason not to, I think
		* photograph that for the cover
		* make the title visible: but the title will have to have the word 'submarine' in it so people know what the story is about with no visual cover
		* this will do a nice job of distinguishing it as a 'rougher' 'short story' --- it reads as an opportunity to get at a draft for free of something else maybe
* they smuggle a hold full of expensive watches. the watches get wound up with the movement of the boat. while running silent under the authority ship the sonar realizes they can hear the watches. down in the silence of the hold with no engine running, the ticking is clearly audible, like the telltale heart. possibly audible to the authority ship.
* the watches are a shipment from one of the authority govts to field troops to use for artillery 
* maybe it through sheer chance that many of the watches start ticking in synchronicity.
* what are the Authority ships doing? depth charging them? What the consequence of the ticking watches being heard?
* (See note on Authorities 'pulling over' a sub in main subworld story elements list)


## Rough layout for plot:
* Start with a description of the sea as a great black greasy stain on the Earth. A pool of filth and oil that sways back and forth around the world, pulled by the invisible grip of the moon.
* A description of submarines as subconsious objects, out there in the world, below the grease pool surface, never seen, occupying space literally below the surface, below the surface of our consciousness.
* On board the Prospect, they are cruising on the surface. Stacks blowing flame (see rough description)
* On the radar they spot a ship -- some kind of Authority enforcer; a non-wartime destroyer.
	* (Maybe a commericial vessel converted for listening and enforcing.
	* Perhaps a limited number of armaments for that reason -- they mostly have the power to patrol, and call in more aggressive machines if necessary.
* It creeps into sight and hits them over the ship-to-ship. (Maybe a slow chase into range?)
	* It idenfies itself as an authority boat, tracking them out of port from another authority
	* It orders them to stop and prepare to be boarded because they are suspected of carrying weapons or weapons components
	* "Weapons components? We're carrying a shipment of wristwatches" "...intended for distribution to infantry for timing artillery strikes"
		* "If they board us they will likely seize the shipment. They might seize the whole boat."
* Percy crash dives the Prospect.
* She points the boat down, gets some speed, and then kills the motors. They drift downward, guided by the bow planes and inertia, steering the rudder to randomly changing direction.
* They slip under the isotherm, and come to a dead stop.
	* Don't even bother addressing the active-sonar question. For the story, it's all about the surface ship _listening_ for them. 
* They wait in silence. (build tension from nothing here)
* Randomly, the ticking of the wristwatches come into sync
	* Cassandra, swinging the sonar mics around, suddenly hears it when she lines up with the front of the boat.
	* She describes the ticking in her ears, growing louder.
* They hold on, panicked, until randomness re-asserts itself and the watches de-sync
	* It's about randomness: it clumps together and endangers them, comes apart and they are free. 
* They drift off with a deep-water current until they are out of range of the pursuers.
