# Subworld Short Story #1 -- Rough Draft From As-Typed Version



Contrary to conventional notions, the oceans of our world are in fact vast slow-moving cauldrons of pitch and oil. A viscous and black liquid into which the light of the sun barely seeps, penetrating only enough to create a dim penumbra glow at the very edges if one were taking the totality of the ocean's mass into account when one considered them. Which is how one should consider the oceans. They are not separate basins slowly dribbling back and forth from one to the other, but a single huge mass of greasy black lubricant, malevolently yanked bodily back and forth by the moon twice a day. The oceans are no some porpoise-filled, cycle-of-life-affirming, three-dimensional, Earth-in-its-natural-state playground, they are the greatest force of never-ending darkness in our world. For that reason we rarely think about them. What oceans actually are is literally out-of-sight, and out of mind.

For most of us.

Pushing their way slowly through the thick blackness are thousands and thousands of objects --- steel tubes with no windows that feel their way by sound alone. These objects, at home in the subconscious medium of the black ocean, are also rarely considered or thought about. They are objects that reside in our cultural subconscious, occupying a mostly forgotten space. That is, in fact the intention of the objects --- to be forgotten as they traverse a forgotten medium. To become conscious of them is for their central function to have failed.

These objects --- 'boats' is the term-of-art, but commonly called submarines --- are mechanical objects. They were built by humans, who spend most of their time wandering the sub-baked, dry crusty parts of the planet, and chose to put the very limits of their mechanical skills to the test to create these objects that would allow them to exist and move through a field where every aspect of their delicate life-requirements needed a mechanical intervention. That is, to pass through liquid death.

The boats are forgotten, but there is no home that does not contain many everyday objects that passed through the hold of one of these machines. They enable the trade and logistics that make our culture of things possible.

While in our surface world trade has ground to a near-halt by the never-ending soft-power bickering and dispute, the cargo submarines and their crews have used their clandestine stealth to make trade possible. Like the liquid ocean rolling back and forth, the cargo submarines have created a subconscious flow of their own --- a kind of beneath-the-consciousness global economic commerce.

The *Prospect* was one of these cargo subs. Roughly a hundred meters long and painted black, its forward half was almost entirely an empty void designed to be loaded up with cargo of any type that could be fit into its hold. A short distance back from the bow of this boat sprang short wings from the side --- the planes that could be angled to control whether the machine moved up or down in the water. About two-thirds of the length back on this steel tube, a large black dorsal fin sprouted up --- the sail --- which attained a height of about seven meters. two-thirds again the height of the main tube of the submarine itself. The top of the sail was inset with a shallow well --- the bridge --- from which the boat could be directed while it was running on the surface.

Which is what it was doing right now. The *Prospect* was a diesel-electric boat --- like nearly all civilian cargo subs and Authority war machines at the time of this story. It generally ran on the surface at night, driven by its powerful diesel engines and charging its batteries at the same time. During the day, it would submerge and run down the battery charge as its nearly-silent electric motors pushed it through the oily depths.

While surfaced at night, Captain Percy generally preferred to be on the bridge at the top of the sail, at least if the weather was anything other than awful. On this particular night Percy smoked through one blunt wrap of tobacco after another, elbows resting on the fairing of the sail, facing the rear of the boat. The tobacco smoke rose up and quickly wafted off into the breeze, dispersed and invisible against the gray star-stuffed night sky.

At the rear of the sail, directly in Captain Percy's gaze, two black fingers rose up into the air above. From the tips of those fingers flames of glowing red, that occasionally brightened to a lush orange, arced up into the sky and were blown backwards by the breeze the boat was charging into. Black soot poured off the end of the flames and climbed up and held in the air, infinite little particles of black that coalesced together and formed into a cloud. The cloud of soot marked the bath of the passing boat, rising up behind it. Unfortunately, it left a signal, a path of breadcrumbs, that other vessels could follow. The *Prospect* cut across the oily surface, writing its history as it went.

Up above Captain Percy in the lookout ring, a huge man --- huge in both girth and height --- had wedged himself. He was holding a large pair of binoculars and slowly completing a 360-degree scan of the black line where the horizon of the ocean met the gray of the sky.

"See anything Hemi?" Captain Percy called up to the big man, more to break up the monotony than because any report was actually needed.

"No Sylvia." He replied. "It is one of those nights where the planes of the sea and the sky look like they have been hammered against each other, and there is no space left for even the tiniest mote to squeeze between them."

Percy pulled at her cigarillo and looked up at the dome of stars above her, made impossibly flat by nothing but the sheer and unfathomable distance. Even with no moon, the stars glowed with a brightness that made the whole sky shine with a celestial light that almost stung the eyes when confronted with the inky unreflective blackness of the sea below.

Half an hour passed in an uninterrupted sensory blackwash. The diesels hummed their unvarying groan-drone, the soles of Percy's boots vibrated, the ocean chop sloshed in a regular pattern along the semi-exposed hull of the boat.

Percy let the second half of her cigarillo burn away between her fingers without remembering to take a puff from it. She was beginning to love the ability to tell whether she was standing on the bridge of her boat or just dreaming it when at the bottom of the ladder at her feet a circular hatch split open and a hellish red glow poured out.

Nothing came through the hatch though except for the voice of a young man, calling up to Percy from the submarine's control room. "Captain Percy, Cassandra says she's got a blip on the radar."

"OK Owen, thanks. What's the range and direction?" She was unconcerned. The oceans were busy and crowded places --- at least on the surface. It would be unusual to make it through a nighttime surface run without encountering at least a few other vessels, even in the remote parts of the world, which this was not particularly.

"The blip is 22 nautical miles --- behind us." There was a pause while more detail was relayed up to Owen from the radar station three decks below where Percy was sanding. "...Almost directly behind us, a little off to the starboard side." 

Percy didn't bother passing the message on up to Hemi, the range was too far to be seen from the lookout ring. Hemi could probably hear what Owen was saying anyway. The contact was well over the horizon. For the moment, there was nothing else Percy could do to divine any further details about this radar blip. But a good cargo-sub driver didn't take unnecessary risks. Better to leave a contact behind than waste any effort trying to identify it. On a cargo sub it was always best to just be left alone, if one could help it. "Owen, push her up to maximum --- 15 knots if she'll do it tonight."

Within the next minute, Percy's keen sense of the motion of her boat told her that they had put on something like 5 more knots of speed, though the pitch of the diesel engines did not change at all. The *Prospect*, like many submarines, was configured for the diesels to always run at the RPMs that produced the maximum efficiency because their job was the generate electricity, not drive the propeller of the boat. That electricity both charged the batteries, and powered the electric motors that did the actual turning of the props. When Owen increased the throttle, the electric motors started spinning faster, but those motors were so quiet relative to the diesel that from the bridge the could not be detected. For anyone used to operating most ships or land vehicles, the changing of velocity without the accompanying change of pitch was one of the many disconcerting things about working on a diesel submarine like the *Prospect*. 

With the boat now going as fast and it was capable of, there was nothing else to do but wait. "Owen, tell Cassandra to keep tracking the blip on radar for now. And you might as well leave the fuckin' hatch open." 

[//]: # (Maybe further develop this idea that for the first part of this story, the scene is up on the bridge, and there are things going on down below the water line in the hull of the boat, but everything that matters comes up to Percy and Hemi on the bridge.)

"Sure Percy." The disembodied voice floated up from below.

Percy list another cigarillo and looked up to catch Hemi's eye when he had lowered the binoculars for a moment. She took the glowing wreath from her lips. "I'm sure I don't fuckin' need to tell you to keep a sharp out behind us?"

"That was indeed my intention Sylvia." Hemi lifted the binoculars and made a slow deliberate scan of the 180 degrees to the rear of the *Prospect*. The black-gray line of the horizon remained as unblemished as it had for the last 24 hours, since they had got out of sight of land after loading up their cargo at the mainland pier they had been docked at.

An hour passed. Percy found that while she had been unintentionally and causally facing the rear of the boat before, now she stood with deliberation at the back of the sail, peering at the trailing wake they left behind them. She let Hemi do the concentrated lookout work, and she focused more on her smoking than watching out behind. At the same time she could not let her gaze wander too long from that black vertical line that always followed off in the distance behind.

Bastian unfolded his thin frame from the hatch and gingerly carried to rubber-coated metal cups of coffee up the ladded to the bridge of the sail. He handed one to Percy and held the other up with his arm fully extended to the long-armed reach of the stooping Hemi. Percy gave Bastian a heartfelt 'thanks.' He just nodded and slithered back down the hole he had come up out of.

Twenty minutes later, Captain Percy though enough time had passed that it was reasonably possible the situation with the radar blip had changed. She cupped a hand around her mouth and called down to Owen in the control room for a report. She could hear her request echoed more faintly down to Cassandra at the radar station deeper within the ship.

[//]: # (Above with Owen relaying might be too quickly repeated from earlier in the story.)

A minute later Owen stood under the open hatch in the ceiling of the control room looking up at her. "Cassandra says the blip is gaining on us Cap. They are at something like twenty nautical miles now."
