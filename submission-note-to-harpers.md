I admit from the start that this story is maybe not typical of Harper's fiction. But before you reject it out of hand for not being some convoluted examination of an excrutiatingly small family dynamic, or a weakly-rendered metaphor told as magical realism, I would like to encourage you to consider whether you really have such a good grip on what our audience would like to read when it comes to fiction. I, for one, excitedly devour everything in Harper's... except the fiction. (I'm a kind person and I don't want to say mean things about other writers, so don't ask me to cite examples... though I assure you it would be easily done.)
