# Subworld Short Story #1 -- Rough Draft From As-Typed Version




[//]: # (One possibility for this story: it could be entirely set in sonar. Also, I think the ship on the surface HAS to be an armed ship. The tension is not high enough when there is no risk of the Prospect being blown out of the water. I like the ending to this as it is, but I think for a short story to suck people in enough to want to read the novel, this has to be more exciting, and let the philosophical stuff take a back seat instead of foregrounding it like the current ending does.)


Contrary to conventional notions, the oceans of our world are in fact vast slow-moving cauldrons of pitch and oil. A viscous and black liquid into which the light of the sun barely seeps, penetrating only enough to create a dim penumbra glow at the very edges if one were taking the totality of the ocean's mass into account when one considered them. Which is how one should consider the oceans. They are not separate basins slowly dribbling back and forth from one to the other, but a single huge mass of greasy black lubricant, malevolently yanked bodily back and forth by the moon twice a day. The oceans are no some porpoise-filled, cycle-of-life-affirming, three-dimensional, Earth-in-its-natural-state playground, they are the greatest force of never-ending darkness in our world. For that reason we rarely think about them. What oceans actually are is literally out-of-sight, and out of mind.

For most of us.

Pushing their way slowly through the thick blackness are thousands and thousands of objects --- steel tubes with no windows that feel their way by sound alone. These objects, at home in the subconscious medium of the black ocean, are also rarely considered or thought about. They are objects that reside in our cultural subconscious, occupying a mostly forgotten space. That is, in fact the intention of the objects --- to be forgotten as they traverse a forgotten medium. To become conscious of them is for their central function to have failed.

These objects --- 'boats' is the term-of-art, but commonly called submarines --- are mechanical objects. They were built by humans, who spend most of their time wandering the sub-baked, dry crusty parts of the planet, and chose to put the very limits of their mechanical skills to the test to create these objects that would allow them to exist and move through a field where every aspect of their delicate life-requirements needed a mechanical intervention. That is, to pass through liquid death.

The boats are forgotten, but there is no home that does not contain many everyday objects that passed through the hold of one of these machines. They enable the trade and logistics that make our culture of things possible.

While in our surface world trade has ground to a near-halt by the never-ending soft-power bickering and dispute, the cargo submarines and their crews have used their clandestine stealth to make trade possible. Like the liquid ocean rolling back and forth, the cargo submarines have created a subconscious flow of their own --- a kind of beneath-the-consciousness global economic commerce.

The *Prospect* was one of these cargo subs. Roughly a hundred meters long and painted black, its forward half was almost entirely an empty void designed to be loaded up with cargo of any type that could be fit into its hold. A short distance back from the bow of this boat sprang short wings from the side --- the planes that could be angled to control whether the machine moved up or down in the water. About two-thirds of the length back on this steel tube, a large black dorsal fin sprouted up --- the sail --- which attained a height of about seven meters. two-thirds again the height of the main tube of the submarine itself. The top of the sail was inset with a shallow well --- the bridge --- from which the boat could be directed while it was running on the surface.

Which is what it was doing right now. The *Prospect* was a diesel-electric boat --- like nearly all civilian cargo subs and Authority war machines at the time of this story. It generally ran on the surface at night, driven by its powerful diesel engines and charging its batteries at the same time. During the day, it would submerge and run down the battery charge as its nearly-silent electric motors pushed it through the oily depths.

While surfaced at night, Captain Percy generally preferred to be on the bridge at the top of the sail, at least if the weather was anything other than awful. On this particular night Percy smoked through one blunt wrap of tobacco after another, elbows resting on the fairing of the sail, facing the rear of the boat. The tobacco smoke rose up and quickly wafted off into the breeze, dispersed and invisible against the gray star-stuffed night sky.

At the rear of the sail, directly in Captain Percy's gaze, two black fingers rose up into the air above. From the tips of those fingers flames of glowing red, that occasionally brightened to a lush orange, arced up into the sky and were blown backwards by the breeze the boat was charging into. Black soot poured off the end of the flames and climbed up and held in the air, infinite little particles of black that coalesced together and formed into a cloud. The cloud of soot marked the bath of the passing boat, rising up behind it. Unfortunately, it left a signal, a path of breadcrumbs, that other vessels could follow. The *Prospect* cut across the oily surface, writing its history as it went.

Up above Captain Percy in the lookout ring, a huge man --- huge in both girth and height --- had wedged himself. He was holding a large pair of binoculars and slowly completing a 360-degree scan of the black line where the horizon of the ocean met the gray of the sky.

"See anything Hemi?" Captain Percy called up to the big man, more to break up the monotony than because any report was actually needed.

"No Sylvia." He replied. "It is one of those nights where the planes of the sea and the sky look like they have been hammered against each other, and there is no space left for even the tiniest mote to squeeze between them."

Percy pulled at her cigarillo and looked up at the dome of stars above her, made impossibly flat by nothing but the sheer and unfathomable distance. Even with no moon, the stars glowed with a brightness that made the whole sky shine with a celestial light that almost stung the eyes when confronted with the inky unreflective blackness of the sea below.

Half an hour passed in an uninterrupted sensory blackwash. The diesels hummed their unvarying groan-drone, the soles of Percy's boots vibrated, the ocean chop sloshed in a regular pattern along the semi-exposed hull of the boat.

Percy let the second half of her cigarillo burn away between her fingers without remembering to take a puff from it. She was beginning to love the ability to tell whether she was standing on the bridge of her boat or just dreaming it when at the bottom of the ladder at her feet a circular hatch split open and a hellish red glow poured out.

Nothing came through the hatch though except for the voice of a young man, calling up to Percy from the submarine's control room. "Captain Percy, Cassandra says she's got a blip on the radar."

"OK Owen, thanks. What's the range and direction?" She was unconcerned. The oceans were busy and crowded places --- at least on the surface. It would be unusual to make it through a nighttime surface run without encountering at least a few other vessels, even in the remote parts of the world, which this was not particularly.

"The blip is 22 nautical miles --- behind us." There was a pause while more detail was relayed up to Owen from the radar station three decks below where Percy was sanding. "...Almost directly behind us, a little off to the starboard side." 

Percy didn't bother passing the message on up to Hemi, the range was too far to be seen from the lookout ring. Hemi could probably hear what Owen was saying anyway. The contact was well over the horizon. For the moment, there was nothing else Percy could do to divine any further details about this radar blip. But a good cargo-sub driver didn't take unnecessary risks. Better to leave a contact behind than waste any effort trying to identify it. On a cargo sub it was always best to just be left alone, if one could help it. "Owen, push her up to maximum --- 15 knots if she'll do it tonight."

Within the next minute, Percy's keen sense of the motion of her boat told her that they had put on something like 5 more knots of speed, though the pitch of the diesel engines did not change at all. The *Prospect*, like many submarines, was configured for the diesels to always run at the RPMs that produced the maximum efficiency because their job was the generate electricity, not drive the propeller of the boat. That electricity both charged the batteries, and powered the electric motors that did the actual turning of the props. When Owen increased the throttle, the electric motors started spinning faster, but those motors were so quiet relative to the diesel that from the bridge the could not be detected. For anyone used to operating most ships or land vehicles, the changing of velocity without the accompanying change of pitch was one of the many disconcerting things about working on a diesel submarine like the *Prospect*. 

With the boat now going as fast and it was capable of, there was nothing else to do but wait. "Owen, tell Cassandra to keep tracking the blip on radar for now. And you might as well leave the fuckin' hatch open." 

[//]: # (Maybe further develop this idea that for the first part of this story, the scene is up on the bridge, and there are things going on down below the water line in the hull of the boat, but everything that matters comes up to Percy and Hemi on the bridge.)

"Sure Percy." The disembodied voice floated up from below.

Percy list another cigarillo and looked up to catch Hemi's eye when he had lowered the binoculars for a moment. She took the glowing wreath from her lips. "I'm sure I don't fuckin' need to tell you to keep a sharp out behind us?"

"That was indeed my intention Sylvia." Hemi lifted the binoculars and made a slow deliberate scan of the 180 degrees to the rear of the *Prospect*. The black-gray line of the horizon remained as unblemished as it had for the last 24 hours, since they had got out of sight of land after loading up their cargo at the mainland pier they had been docked at.

An hour passed. Percy found that while she had been unintentionally and causally facing the rear of the boat before, now she stood with deliberation at the back of the sail, peering at the trailing wake they left behind them. She let Hemi do the concentrated lookout work, and she focused more on her smoking than watching out behind. At the same time she could not let her gaze wander too long from that black vertical line that always followed off in the distance behind.

Bastian unfolded his thin frame from the hatch and gingerly carried to rubber-coated metal cups of coffee up the ladded to the bridge of the sail. He handed one to Percy and held the other up with his arm fully extended to the long-armed reach of the stooping Hemi. Percy gave Bastian a heartfelt 'thanks.' He just nodded and slithered back down the hole he had come up out of.

Twenty minutes later, Captain Percy though enough time had passed that it was reasonably possible the situation with the radar blip had changed. She cupped a hand around her mouth and called down to Owen in the control room for a report. She could hear her request echoed more faintly down to Cassandra at the radar station deeper within the ship.

[//]: # (Above with Owen relaying might be too quickly repeated from earlier in the story.)

A minute later Owen stood under the open hatch in the ceiling of the control room looking up at her. "Cassandra says the blip is gaining on us Cap. They are at something like twenty nautical miles now."

"Fucking gaining?! Does that mean they are on our heading too?"

A pause, while Owen checked below. "She says she can't tell if they have altered course to follow us, or if they just happen to be going in roughly the same direction. But she is sure they are moving faster than us. If it were someone who is deliberately trying to overtake us, they fucking surely will eventually."

"Eh, fuck Owen, you know we'll dive before we let that happen." She looked up at Hemi. "You better get down there and help Cassandra out on radar, we require a little more fucking precision now than that little waif may be capable of delivering." She turned back to Owen. "Come up and take over for Hemi in the lookout ring Owen."

A minute of sideways scuttling to get past Percy followed --- made slower by Hemi's great bulk --- as Hemi and Owen swapped places on the ship. As Owen moved past her, she warned him: "Be sure to keep a sharp lookout behind --- but don't forget to scan around regularly too Owen."

"I know Captain Percy."

He probably did too. Owen was young, but he was sharp. He wouldn't fuck this up. "Fuckin' good. I'm going down to the control room. You let me know if you see the slightest fuckin' coracle out there, fucking right?"

"I know Captain Percy." Owen said again, with the exact same resolute inflection.

Percy wrapped the toes of her boots around the steel sidebars of the ladder and slid down to the cramped space of the deck below. It could hardly be called a deck, it was just a void inside the sail --- filled with water when they were submerged --- just big enough to let you open and close the hatch to the control room. Holding the hand-grabs, she dangled her boots down into the hatch until they found the familiar perch of the second ladder rung down, and then climbed hand-under-hand down into the red-lit control room.

At the moment, it was just her and Bastian in the small space from which the *Prospect* was run. When the control room had its full complement of Captain Percy, two people at the control seats, and huge Hemi acting in his role as Deck Boss, the small space was extremely crowded. But with auch a small crew managing a 100 meter long boat, it was rare that they had the luxury of everyone in the control room that should be there. Usually it only happened when they need to execute a treacherous maneuver.

Bastian was sitting in the rudder/throttle control chair to the right as one faced the bow of the boat. The planes control seat --- where the angle and depth of the submarine was controlled --- was empty since they didn't need anyone controlling the planes tanks while they ran on the surface. Since the course was set and the throttle at max, Bastian didn't have much to do in the rudder control chair either. He sat looking uncomfortable, with his long legs folded up so he could put his feet on the flat steel panel in front of him and trying to demonstrate a casual, leaned-back pose in the stiffly upright metal chair as he puffed away at a cigarette.

Captain Percy lit another cigarillo off Bastian's coal and reached up to weave her fingers into one of the cracking leather straps that hung above what she considered the "Captain's Station" in the control room --- though in reality that spot on the rear left side was simply the only place one could stand where one could see everything that happened in the space.

Dangling with one arm and smoking with the other, she began another hour's watch uninterrupted by event or report from the crew. The night was getting on and she could feel her eyes drooping even as she stood, which meant it was time for coffee.

She lowered herself gingerly down the ladder into the sonar and navigation compartment. As her head cleared the control-room deck, she habitually scanned the sonar room and noticed Hemi was wearing the sonar headset. She stepped over and tapped him on the shoulder. He looked up at her.

"How can you hear anything with the diesels running?" She asked incredulously. "I thought you were down here to watch the radar?"

Hemi sighed and pulled one of the earpieces back. "I cannot, as you suspect. There is too much noise. I thought if I could filter it I might be able to get a better idea of who the contact is. But it is not working. And they gained another couple of miles on us in the meantime." Hemi pointed to the glowing-and-fading dot on the radar sweep, at just under the 20-nautical-mile range mark.

Hemi replaced the earpiece over his ear and returned his attention to the sonar control panel in front of him. With his eyes closed, his thick brown fingers found the switches and dials of the sonar filters with practiced instinct. Every time he made an adjustment to the sonar's settings the pattern displayed by the conglomeration of thin needles on the sonar's display dials would change subtly. Percy knew that in Hemi's ears the sounds he would be hearing from the sonar would be changing along with the filter adjustments. But from where she stood behind him, there was no sound except the unvarying heavy wash of the diesel engines which swept through all these middle compartments of the boat unrelentingly. That diesel bass-hum would be occupying most of the soundscape in Hemi's ears anyway. No sonar filter was sophisticated enough to do a reasonable job of cutting through all that engine noise. She knew Hemi would keep trying though, because if could pick up even a halfway decent sonar signal he would have a shot at identifying the contact long before it came into visual range.

She considered shutting down the diesel and letting Hemi have a good, clear listen. But if she did that, she might as well dive the boat. And that would mean using up precious batter during the part of the day when they were meant to be charging. Until they knew the pursuers were a genuine threat, it was better to simply try to out-distance them. It was most likely that with time their courses would simply diverge. Hemi was likely being overly cautious.

Still. She appreciated Hemi's caution. The man was a serious professional. They were in a business where taking risks got your killed. Or at least your cargo confiscated.

As was so often the case in submarining, what was called for right now more than anything else was patience. Silence and patience were two qualities that made a top submariner. Though those qualities had to be more than just personality elements. Hemi had a generally quiet demeanor, for example, but when Percy thought of his stealthy qualities it was more about how he never took an action rashly, that is, without considering the acoustic impacts of any action he took --- from the simple quiet care he used when handling tools to bold maneuvers of the whole boat.

Likewise, his patience wasn't just a matter of waiting without complaining. Hemi could *endure* long periods in cold, wet, or dangerous conditions. He wasn't just patient, he could suffer the hard stress of patience without complaint. 

As he was doing right now.

He might be listening to that signal-less, mind-scrambling, interminable noise in the sonar headset for the next many hours. But he would do it without even a second thought to the effort required and discomfort that would go along with it.

Percy wasn't she she was even Hemi's equal when it came to patience.

She lit another cigarillo and placed her hand on Hemi's huge hunched shoulder. She sucked slowly at the tobacco, and her eyes carefully weighted the various signal-strength gauges and dials on the sonar unit trying to read something from these poor visual analogues to the sounds Hemi was hearing. 

But there was nothing there. She exhaled and a long stream of smoke raised up like some post-quake oceanic displacement, and worked its way along the ceiling of the compartment until the sub's ventilation system found it and consumed it.

Time took on the characteristics of the hour hand on a clock. It crept relentlessly forward so that Percy and Hemi, when they considered it, noticed the changing status of their situation. For example: the glowing dot on the radar was measurably closer than it had been. But the hours passed with no distinguishing features to mark them. It was a mental state that was all too common on submarines, and one for which tobacco smoking was a particularly well-adapted pastime.

Captain Percy found herself chain smoking. She smoked her cigarillos slowly, but as the hot coal of one --- with its thin stream of smoke rising up to her nostrils --- burned down enough to start warming her fingertips, she would pull the next from the pack in her chest pocket and place it gently between her lips while holding the smoldering and not-long-for-this-world's forebear to the end of it while drawing air in. A new generation of cigarillo was aflame with its brief and fluorescing life, and Percy would ensure that it slowly and steadily ran the course of its own short life, and made sure it would be ready to pass its flame on to the next generation.

The steady creation of smoke in the cramped space meant the ventilation system had not a chance, even with the hatch above the control room open to the outside air. The compartment was soon filled with a thick haze that did not move or dissipate any faster than their watch on the time.

With nothing in his headphones to cut the grinding never-ending bass of the diesel engines, Hemi had opened his eyes and let them causally wash over the dials and gauges in front of him. He soon realized that his eyes were watering from the smoke in the compartment and from forgetting to blink as the small needles hovered without movement in a cryptic array of silent noise before him.

He took a grease pencil and marked 20-minute increments on the round gauge that was the sonar unit's clock. Every time the hands on the face of the gauge drew even with one of his pencil marks he would do a full 360 degree scan with the sonar, and then point it back at the bearing behind them where the radar indicated the pursuing vessel was located. Then he went through a systematic process of flipping filters on and off to see if he could yet detect the contact on sonar.

But Hemi was soon losing any sense of how many of those 20-minute increments he had passed. It seemed like there may never be anything to hear on sonar. He was beginning to doubt the sonar ever gave anything but unremitting noise to him. Did the unit even work? Did the concept of using underwater microphones for navigation and vessel detection even have any validity? He lived by this technology every day, but sometimes it was hard to believe it was not just some arcane form of magic.

Percy felt a cool breeze tickling the hairs on the back of her neck. A faint breeze, that through the vagaries of air pressure and ventilation system had worked its way down from the vigorous life it had outside, through the inviting open hatch into the control room, and from there in a less-likely feat to stir the air in the sonar compartment deep inside the boat. The little zephyr gave some life to the coal of the cigarillo burning in her hand and it glowed with more effervescence.

The renewed glow of the coal held between her fingers drew Percy's attention. She lifted the cigarillo to her lips and sucked oxygenated accelerant across the coal giving it even more life. She withdrew the smoldering little stick and held it out in front of her, the back of her hand facing up, the coal raised up and smoking down towards her fingers. She studied it for a moment without conscious thought. The coal burned without sound, consuming its fuel and some of the oxygen she otherwise might have put to work in her own lungs. The coal flared up a little in the faint breeze igniting into a brief flame, and then died back to a dull ember. It crawled imperceptibly slowly towards her fingers.

[//]: # (Above graf has got to go, or this time-filling stuff has to be framed better. It moved too quickly into these slow parts, I think. The moved like the hour hand on a clock business is not enough, I think. Maybe it will improved on a full-speed re-read though.)

Percy turned away from the sonar unit and the back of her hand and stepped up to the navigation table behind her. Her hand found the light switch for the navigation table by instinct alone, and the cold pale light cut lines down through the dimness of the compartment to bring the chart laid out on the table into the daylight of the world. She lifted a flat grease pencil from the holder next to the chart and took a straight-edge from the hook it hung on. She laid the tool on the chart and scribbled some nearly illegible numbers onto a piece of scrap paper. Then she laid down a single hash-mark on the glass that covered the chart, extending their marked course across the ocean by precisely that much.

She tapped the uncut end of the pencil against the glass for a moment, but the percussive sound was disconcerting, coming as it did over the top of the drowning drone of the diesel engines. She put the pencil down and flipped the navigation table light off.

Her eyes scanned around the compartment. The forward half, where Hemi sat, was stuffed with equipment. Steel cases were stacked floor-to-ceiling and each case protected innards of delicate electronics. Each case was a particular modular unit that either fed information into another unit, or was studded with switches, knobs, dials, and gauges --- sometimes accompanied by some kind of main display like the radar scope or the sonar range finder. The unit Hemi sat in front of was like that, but there were dozens more in place against the front wall of the compartment.

[//]: # (Clearly, above is not working -- the word cases is not giving the right image of what these look like, and its not clear the look-around-the-compartment thing is working at all. An experiment failed, I think.)

Further back, the equipment got less electronic, but remained technical. The sonar and navigation compartment was the nerve center of the boat after all. The navigation table was surrounded by stacks of rolled charts and lay on top of a stack of flat-files containing more charts. There were other workstations to stand at along the wall, kitted out for various navigation tasks, and for doing the calculations required to keep sharp their sense of where in the world the boat was located.

[//]: # (Regarding next 2 grafs: I had the idea that it might be a good style to ONLY include detailed descriptions of the spaces --- give visual, cinematic life to the room. Here I slipped back into explaining mechanical systems. I'm not sure the style of pure visual description was working at all --- see above note --- but this mechanical-systems description doesn't belong here regardless. It probably doesn't belong in this story at all, since there's no main ballast blow. It MIGHT have a place in the novel...)

The walls were run with rusting and painted-over pipes. At various locations along the pipes were valves that could be turned, either by hand or with a wrench. Most of the boat's physical control systems were routed through this room even though they were generally controlled elsewhere --- the idea being that in an emergency a single person from the control room could manipulate the boat's actions by pure physical force if they were in a desperate situation. The day-to-day operations happened elsewhere, so these particular valves had not been turned in years. Percy was unsure how many of them even could be turned at this point, and hoped she never had to find out.

Toward the read of the compartment, four fat pipes were routed along the wall. Unlike the myriad other pipes of the more minor systems, these were the main ballast blow pipes. Like the smaller pipes, they too had big valves set in them, designed to be turned by a large wrench. But these had been used more recently. Testing minor systems was something Percy didn't feel like they had time for. But testing this main safety system --- the only way back to the surface in a real emergency --- was something that she did enforce. Besides that, they had been in a few scrapes in recent years where a main ballast blow had been necessary.

[//]: # (You should use this story as an opportunity to figure out precisely the style you want to use for the novel. Cinematic, certainly --- but how to achieve that? Lots of visual description? Even in movies it's not like there's an infinite amount of visual description: for a movie its all about CHOOSING how much visuals to use, good movies are often very restrained. And where is the place for similes, metaphors, and more flowery language? And what about emotion --- a good story isn't about visuals, its about emotion. Can you write at least this story so people who maybe dont like the confined space and grit do at least find some kind of beauty in the story --- even if that never happens for the novel, maybe the more art premise of the ticking clocks here could make that happen. Also: the ticking clock conceit at the center of the story --- focus on the aesthetics of that and make sure the rest of the story feels like it fits as a frame around that, aesthetically.)

She turned to the steel ladder that stood in the middle of the compartment and slowly climbed it --- up through the average-human-width-sized hole cut in the deck above that led into the control room. She lifted herself to her feet in the control room and reached above to grab the leather strap. She let the strap take a portion of her weight, the old cracked leather coming to a noose around her small wrist. She reached out her free hand with the smoking cigarillo between her fingers and poked a couple of bony finger-ends into the ribs of Bastian's back. His head had been dropping in a sure sign the man had less than total awareness of the status of the 100-meter vessel he was currently solely responsible for.

"Bastian, you need to keep your skinny ass fucking awake." Percy said to the back of his head. "Don't you rucking realize we are being fucking pursued? How the fuck are you nodding off?"

"Pursuit... at 15 knots. I could run faster than this."

"Not in fucking water you couldn't. And the speed is exactly the fucking problem. We're going flat out, and that blip down there on the radar in front of Hemi is steadily gaining on us."

"They've been fucking gaining on us for hours. When are we going to do something about about?" Asked Bastian. "You give me a fucking action to take, and I'll be wide fucking awake, no fucking doubt."

"As soon as we fucking know anything for sure, we will take fucking action Bastian. Till then, I pay you to stay awake at the wheel regardless of whether there is any action. If you need help, you can go get yourself a cup of coffee from the galley."

"Right Cap." It was the middle of the night and there was certainly no point in arguing with Percy. He unfurled himself from the metal chair of the rudder control station and stood. He put a thin hand-rolled cigarette to his lips and withdrew it again while spitting out a small fluff of tobacco. Replacing the cigarette, he lit it from a match struck against the underside of his seat and left the cigarette hanging from his lip as he lowered his long skinny body down the ladder from the control room.

Percy sighed and sucked at her cigarillo as she scanned over the wall of dials in front of her. None of the small black needs was moving because they were currently maintaining a steady rate in a fixed direction. The depth-under-keel gauge was resting on its 'bottomless' pin.

She couldn't blame Bastian for getting drowsy. There was currently nothing to do in the control room. The only thing moving was on the radar screen in the compartment below and out of sight for the person sitting at the rudder controls. Still, she knew she was not at any risk of falling asleep herself, not until they had some sense of who the vessel following them was, and whether they represented a threat. Perhaps she should take over for Bastian and let him get in his rack for a few hours.

"Where are they now Hemi?" Percy leaned over the hatch down to the sonar compartment and lifted her voice to ensure Hemi heard her question.

"They are about 15 nautical miles off. They are gaining on us at a rate of just about one nautical mile every hour." Hemi called back.

"Are they tracking us on radar?"
"They certainly are. I'm regularly detecting their radar sweep. They are not being shy about their own position."

Percy thought for a minute. "So if you're seeing their radar you have very precise information about their location, heading, and speed?"

"That is correct."

"And they are definitely on our course?"

"Dead on."

Percy knew they had been tracking the contact long enough now that the chances that they just happened to be sharing the same heading were rapidly growing remote. Whoever the other vessel was, they were almost certainly tracking and trying to overtake the *Prospect*. Captain Percy did not like that. Being that the whole point of shipping goods with a cargo submarine was to avoid the attention of other vessels on the ocean, a cargo sub like the *Prospect* had very little chance of interacting with another vessel in what might be described as a 'friendly' way. Particularly if that other vessel was a surface vessel and not another cargo sub.

"OK." Said Percy. "Shut down the radar Hemi. There's no reason we should make this easy for them. Keep trying to pick them up on sonar. Failing that, I'm sure we'll get a visual on them sooner than we would care for."

"I estimate we will be able to see them by dawn." Said Hemi.

[//]: # (Percy lowers the boat to decks-awash)

Percy stepped up to the panel off to one side that controlled the trim tanks of the boat. She flipped a few switches and opened a valve. Far off in the innards of the *Prospect* she could hear water flowing through pipes. She kept her eye on the depth gauge and watched it rise two meters before she closed the valves to the trim tanks.

"Are we diving Captain Percy?"

She looked up. Owen's head was a dark shadow two decks above her looking down from the bridge of the sail. "No Owen, I would have sounded the alarm if we were diving. I wouldn't have left you up there! No, I wanted to get the deck under water so we make less of a radar target. Get back in the lookout ring and keep a sharp eye out behind us. Hemi estimates we'll be able to see that pursuing contact by morning."

"Right Captain Percy, I will."

With just the sail above water, the *Prospect* could still run on the diesel engines and would be harder to spot on radar. Still, any modern radar unit would likely be good enough to track even the much smaller target of the sail alone. This move was a practical step, but not a permanent solution.

Percy climbed up to the bridge. Nothing had changed above-decks except the man the lookout ring was the much-smaller Owen, and the sound of the water rushing past the boat was much louder and closer now. She looked over the side of the sail and right down into the black liquid cut by white wake rendered a pale gray by the dim star light. With most of the boat underwater, it made it look from her perspective like the small sail she rode atop of was all there was to her vessel. It made her feel small and exposed under that immense dome of stars.

It was also quieter since the engines were now muffled by the meter or so of water covering them. That didn't diminish the bass rumble that escaped from the exhaust plume streaming up from the open pipes behind her, but the more atmospheric bass resonance she was used to when the ran on the surface was gone. It felt peaceful. Or at least peaceful in perspective. Or as peaceful as you could expect when being driven along at a clip by huge engines deriving their power from contained and directed explosions.

Unfortunately, the sound that didn't reach her ears through the air was almost certainly being dispersed through the water instead. Running sail-out might make for a smaller radar target, but they were probably that much easier to track on sonar. There were always trade-offs.

Percy lit another cigarillo and chatted casually with Owen, lifting her voice so he could hear her from the lookout ring. He seemed to be run through with boredom, which made sense since there was nothing to see through the binoculars except for the black line of pitch at the horizon where the dim stars came down to meet the Earth. Percy felt that chatting with Owen would help keep him sharp for a job that was a sure soporific.

But there was only so much to talk about with such little sensory input to spark conversation. It was not long after the glowing butt of her cigarillo had taken off into the wake behind that their conversation dwindled off. Percy lit another and puffed at it slowly, trying to make the smoking consume the time.

She wasn't sure, she may have closed her eyes for a minute. It was an undisciplined thing for a captain to do, but she opened them when the warm glow of her cigarillo burned the back of her fingers.

She tossed the butt out into the pitch, watching the orange glow spark and gain life before going dark, traveling off to some nether-world to find its mate.

After that, it was possible she closed her eyes again.

When she opened them next, the horizon had taken on a soft white glow that washed out the stars and gave the water line a firm twice-penciled-over definition.

Owen coughed. "I've got a shadow on the horizon Captain Percy." He was looking intently through the binoculars at the sea behind them.

"Give me the binoculars Owen."

He squatted down, steadying himself with one hand on the steel of the lookout ring and extending an arm with the binoculars held out to her. Percy took them and lifted them to her eyes. She adjusted the focus while scanning slowly along the black field edge that marked the ocean's horizon.

She wasn't seeing anything. Owen's slightly higher vantage might be giving him just the bit of extra sight distance he needed to see the target. From above her he held out an arm with a pointing finger to help narrow down the area she needed to search. 

A few minutes later she had it. For the moment, it was nothing more than a black needle point sticking up from the perfect flatness of the horizon. But even as she watched it was growing and gaining definition. The sky was also shifting from a pale gray to a soft orange as the dawn made its way up. 

Percy leaned over and yelled down to Bastian in the control room: "Send Hemi up." She could hear some further indistinguishable shouts further down in the boat. Then silence for a minute, followed shortly after by a big man squeezing through the hatch at the top of the control room as he made his way up to the bridge. As he got his feet under him and rose to his full height, Percy handed him the binoculars while pointing out the direction he should look with her free hand. He only peered through the binoculars for a minute before asking Owen to let him have the lookout ring.

Hemi got situated and Percy let Owen go below deck for coffee. Hemi Peered silently and steadfastly behind them. Minutes went by before Percy realized it could be a while before Hemi had anything to report. She lit another cigarillo.

A full twenty minutes passed, during which the sky flooded with glowing liquid orange and red. Percy could now make out the shadow-spot that was their pursuers with her naked eye.

"Well Hemi?"

Without lowering the binoculars, Hemi gave the best report he could. "I am not sure Sylvia. To the best of my knowledge it is a civilian vessel, not military. It has the basic shape of a cargo ship. A bulk hauler or possibly an oiler. I cannot really make that jibe with the distinct sense I have that they are on our tail though."

"I've heard that sometimes civilian ships are shanghaied by Authorities for doing tracking and reporting work. The Authorities deputize them and give them the power to call in a true warship if a situation needs it."

"I have heard that too. But it remains uncommon. It angers the ship owners when Authorities cut into their profits by using their ships for surveillance work."

"That might be, but it's also a fact that no surface vessel moves anywhere without the blessing of an Authority. And those fuckers have already convinced me that they are well out of the realm of pure fucking chance that they are following precisely the same course as us. Those two things together have me wanting to lose those assholes as fast as possible."

"I would call it dawn now anyway."

"Fuckin' true, that is.. We should have a full charge on the batteries by now. Let's go fuckin' quiet, deep, and slow before they get any closer." She punched the dive alarm button tucked under the fairing of the sail and a loud electric buzzer sounded through the boat in a way that was impossible to ignore.

[//]: # (They dive the boat.)

Hemi slid with more grace than would seem possible down from the lookout ring and followed Percy down the ladder and through the hatch into the control room. Hemi sealed the hatch above his head. He was tall enough to do it without standing on the lower rungs of the ladder, unlike Percy. Percy flipped the white lights on in the control room and sonar compartment and simultaneously turned off the red night lighting.

Owen arrived in the control room with a cup of coffee in a metal cup, summoned by the dive alarm from which he knew he would be needed to sit in one of the control chairs.

"Bastian, take the dive planes. Owen, you're on rudder."

Bastian shifted his skinny body over to the chair to his left without fully standing erect and sat cracking his knuckles in anticipation while Owen slipped into the rudder control seat Bastian had just vacated. Hemi stood behind the two men, and Captain Percy took her position at the back of the small compartment.

"Owen, shut down the diesels. Switch us to battery."

Owen half-stood and flipped the big power switches to the diesel engines. The bass rumble that had pervaded their environment for long hours sputtered and faded away leaving on the faint background hum of the electric motors, now driven by the huge banks of batteries buried deep in the belly of the *Prospect*. Percy knew the humming electric motors would soon seem plenty loud enough to be terrifying, but in the wake of the diesel rumble so recently extinguished they seemed like a blessed and sacred silent penance.

"Open the main ballast valves. Bastian, give us a couple of degrees down on the dive planes. Owen, slow us to three knots."

Hemi stepped to Bastian's left where the tank trim control panel was mounted to the wall. The switches that controlled the main ballast valves were large recessed switches set in the lower right quarter of the tank trim control panel among dozens of other switches that controlled valves to less critical tanks and other elements of the boat's buoyancy system. Hemi' hand was large enough that by splaying two of his thick brown fingers he could operate the two switches simultaneously. As he propped them up a loud electro-magnetic clank echoed through the steel hull into the control room. This was followed by a much louder hiss of hair as the gas that had held them aloft at the surface of the ocean escaped up into the atmosphere above.

Bastian eased the dive plan control wheel around and the bow of the boat nosed downward in front of them. They traveled gently downhill like this for a few minutes. Owen watched the depth gauge with his fingers wrapped around the throttle lever. He knew the boat needed a little momentum to drive it downward, so he didn't want to cut the throttle back yet. When the depth showed twenty meters, he eased back the throttle and the electric motor hum died away to almost inaudible.

The angle of the boat gave them all the distinct sensation of sinking, but it was a gradual and controlled dive. Hemi watched the gauges and when the boat had achieved approximately neutral buoyancy, he flipped closed the main ballast valves. This left the main ballast tanks partially filled with air. If it had been an emergency dive, he would have let the tanks fill completely with water.

At fifty meters, Percy had Bastian level the boat off. Hemi went to work at the tank trim control panel. He spent the next twenty minutes making minor adjustments --- pushing compressed air into some of the smaller trim tanks and releasing it from others until he was satisfied that the *Prospect* would float evenly starboard to port and bow to stern regardless of whether any other force was applied to the boat.

By the time Hemi had the boat trimmed, the quiet ennui of slow cruising had set in. Operating a submarine was a difficult-to-adapt-to mix of passive quiet focus punctuated at random intervals by the active attention required to execute a maneuver. Few people haf the personality to switch smoothly between those two modes.

Half an hour after the descent from the surface, the control room was filled with smoke from half-consumed tobacco products, and gauges on the wall held all their little black needles at an unmoving attention. Bastian and Owen had slouched into vaguely more comfortable positions in the metal chairs designed to be uncomfortable so the person sitting in them would not doze off. Owen help his empty coffee cup in front of him and tapped his fingernails quietly against it. Bastian had a cigarette smoking between his fingers, but he seemed to more or less have forgotten it was there.

Captain Percy had one arm up, her wrist again slung from the leather strap hanging from the ceiling. With her other hand she sucked at her mostly-smoked cigarillo. She kept her hand int he strap above not so much for support as a way to keep her free hand from fidgeting with anything else. There was nothing for her to do at the moment. But she was nervous. She had sent Hemi down to the sonar station as soon as he had trimmed the boat. If anything were to come of the cargo ship that seemed to be uncannily locked onto the same course as the *Prospect*, they would most likely learn about it from Hemi's sonar tracking that he was doing right now. With the only background noise being the nearly silent, slow-moving electric motors, he would have a much more clear picture of what the cargo ship was doing.

[//]: # (Hemi tracks the other ship on sonar)

In the sonar compartment directly below the control room, Hemi sat hunched over the sonar unit with the large headset of the sonar covering his ears and his eyes closed. His heavy fingers lay on top of the stainless steel wheel that controlled the directional underwater microphones of the sonar equipment. He slowly eased the small wheel back and forth across the bearing directly to their stern. There was noise from the turning prop in that direction, but a cargo ship is no clandestine or subversive vessel. He could easily track the noise of the quickly spinning double-props and the louder bunker-fuel burning engines.

"Sylvia," Hemi called up to the control room, "I am sure you already know that the contact has been steadily gaining on us since we slowed."

"What's the range now?" She called back.

"Only five nautical miles or so." Said Hemi with a glance at the ranging equipment to confirm what he already knew from the signal in his earphones. "I would suggest a course change is in order."

"I'm fuckin' with you on that Hemi. Though... there is no way they have any actual idea where we are now. Cargo ship is unlikely to be equipped with sonar, and even if they were they could hardly be tracking us over their own engine noise. Owen, make it 0-2-2."

Owen sat up straight in his chair and eased the rudder control wheel half way around to the starboard side. They could all feel the gentle turning motion of the boat, and Owen kept his eyes on the gauge directly in front of his eyes that showed their course --- the compass. Its black needle, lit by a yellow light from below, climbed up and over the apex of the dial and made it steady way into the double-digits. Owen turned the rudder control back the other way, slightly past the zero mark to take some of the impetus off their turn, and then centered the rudder leaving the *Prospect* dead on an 0-2-2 course.

Without the *Prospect's* prop noise in the way, and considering the close range to the contact, Hemi could now hear the cargo ship with exceptional clarity. By shifting the sonar direction back and forth, he could listen to each of the ship's two props individually. He centered the mics on the ship and listened to the sound of their engines for a while. In his head he categorized their power and configuration among all he knew about ship engines from many years of listening to them. He could hear the sound of the water as it slid along the hull. Nothing he heard gave any indication that the ship wasn't exactly what it appeared to be: a totally unexceptional heavy-hauler, right down to the lack of maintenance that had left its port-side prop dented and cavitating noisily.

The only strange thing about the ship was its dead-on course towards the *Prospect*.

After 10 minutes Captain Percy checked in. "Hemi, have they changed direction?" She almost hesitated to ask, knowing that there was no mechanism other than random chance that could steer them more directly towards her boat now.

[//]: # (^- what?)

"No Sylvia. But they have gained another mile towards us, more or less."

"Yeah, well we're hardly screaming out of this area going three knots."

"Should we put some more speed on Cap?" Owen asked, his fingers pressed against the back of the throttle control stick. "Even if they're equipped with sonar for some reason, they couldn't hear us over the noise of their own engines."

"Yeah, but you know how the batteries are Owen. If we go buzzing out of here at top fuckin' speed we'll run the batteries down in an hour or two. We keep it slow and steady, we can maneuver down here for 24 hours or more. Silent and slow while submerged is the name of the game kid."

Silence settled back down on them. Another half hour passed, and Hemi reported that the contact had gained three miles in its original direction, while the *Prospect* had moved off a mile and a half in its new direction. There was now only a total distance of two miles between the two vessels. But if the cargo ship didn't change course it would soon be passing far out into its own range.

Percy was beginning to relax into her normal state of quiet patience for submerged daytime running. She was even considering hitting the rack for a few hours of sleep. Fifteen silent minutes passed as she worked steadily on a cigarillo. But the tobacco wasn't doing what she needed it to. She gave up on it and stubbed the coal out against the sole of her boot. She tossed the cold remaining stump at an empty and rusting tomato can strapped to a post near Owen's feet. In her head she made the call --- it was the rack for her. She hooked the toes of her boots around the rails of the ladder and slipped down to the sonar compartment below.

Hemi's bulk stayed stone still at the sonar station. He had the big earpieces clamped tightly to his ears. Percy was about to step past him, making her way to the narrow forward stair that would take her down to her captain's quarters when he slowly raised one hand. She stopped in her track, staring at the back of his massive head. 

Three seconds passed.

"They shut down their engines Sylvia."

"You're fucking kidding me, just now?"

Hemi nodded.

She thought for just a few seconds more than shouted up to the control room. "Owen, full stop." Two seconds after that the gentle whine of the *Prospect's* electric motors faded away leaving her boat in absolute silence.

Whispering now, even though it was unnecessary: "give me the possibilities Hemi. Why would they have shut down?" This exercise was more about being thorough and rational than because she didn't know what was going on.

"Well," Hemi spoke softly, as was his manner, though not at a whisper, "engine trouble is always a possibility. But I was tracking them very closely when they shut down. It sounded like a clean shutdown to me, not something mechanical failing. Also... they shut down at what is very likely the last location they would have been able to hear out diesels when they were running."

"Right. Other possibilities?"

"Could be that they need some kind of Authority authorization before moving into a different sector. The bureaucracies of many Authorities don't move fast enough to keep up with much of their condoned surface shipping."

"Possible. But that doesn't seem likely to me. What else?"

"The only other possibility that comes to mind, and unfortunately what seems the most likely to me, is they are equipped with some kind of sophisticated passive sonar unit, and they have stopped to listen to us."

"Which means they weren't tailing us... they were *hunting* us."

Hemi nodded. "With our motor shut down, we are playing a hole in the water. There is nothing for them to hear even if they have listening equipment."

"Precisely my intention. There's nothing fuckin' for it now but to wait and see what their next move is. You keep on 'em. Let me know as soon as they do any fucking thing."

"Right, Sylvia." Hemi lowered the earpieces back over his ears, and his fingers found the sonar directional-control wheel. He closed his eyes and slowly started scanning the underwater microphones back and forth across the direction he last heard the engines of the cargo ship.

Percy picked up her journey to her captain's quarters through the now dark and perfectly silent submarine. She stepped forward through the compartment ahead of sonar. She didn't bother flipping on the lights even though that would be good practice --- something she might give any other crew member a hard time about. But she knew her boat well enough to find the forward stair well, narrow and steep as it was, without the aid of the overhead lights.

She rolled up into her rack without turning on the lights in her captain's quarters either. She was asleep in a matter of seconds, taking advantage of the ideal sleeping conditions. A submarine could sometimes be profoundly dark and quiet. 

Less than fifteen minutes passed before she was awakened by Cassandra standing over her, he head the only thing between Percy and the glaring overhead light Cassandra had flipped on when she came in the room. 

"Captain?" Cassandra hesitated. "Are you awake?"

"Fuck no I am not, Cassandra."

"Hemi asked me to tell you that they have started their engines again."

"Fuck. I guess I should have fucking suspected that." She groaned her way to an upright position.

"Do you want this cup of coffee?" Cassandra extended a hand with a scorching hot metal mug.

Percy took it and raised it to her lips. She looked down at it through squinting eyes as she blew the steam off the surface. "Smells like fucking asphalt and shitberries. Did Hemi suggest you bring the coffee when you woke me up?"

"No, I just figured..."

"Well, you figured fucking right. Nice work. Let's go see what the fuck Hemi is on to."

Cassandra stood to one side to let Percy pass and lead the way back up to sonar.

Hemi sat with his eyes closed, listening. But as soon as Cassandra and Percy entered the room he could sense their presence and he opened his eyes and pulled back one earphone.

"What's the status Hemi?" Percy asked, holding her coffee cup with the tips of her fingers clipped to the edges to keep from burning herself.

"They are moving again... and they turned right towards us."

"Motherfuckers. Well, that answers that. They definitely have listening gear, and they are absolutely fucking tracking us."

"But why?" Cassandra asked.

"Fuck if I know." Said Percy. "But now I'm absolutely fucking sure I want to lose them. What's the range Hemi?"

"They are about two miles off."

"Virtually fucking on top of us. But... my guess is they do not have a very precise fix on us. We went dead quiet very shortly after they stopped their engines. Does that seem right Hemi?"

"I concur."

"Alright, Then let's stay put. Stay silent. Maybe they'll shoot right over the top of us."

Hemi nodded.

"Hemi, keep tracking them. Give me updates every five minutes. Cassandra, sit and listen with Hemi. Can't hurt to have two sets of ears on this."

Cassandra lifted the second headset and got the earpieces settled around her ears as Percy climbed the ladder to the control room.

Another cigarillo was picked from the pack in Percy's pocket and made its way to her lips. From lighting it, she lifted her eyes and scanned them across the wall of dials and gauges looking for anything that might be off from where it should be. But nothing had changed since she had last checked the boat's status. Bastian and Owen both had their feet up and Owen's eyes were closed as he sat uncomfortably in the rudder-control chair. Bastian's eyes were open, but just barely.

Percy let her mind wander. She pictured her submarine's position in the water relative to the cargo ship that was flying above her head. On the one hand, she felt fairly secure. It was unlikely the cargo ship had sophisticated detection equipment, and that left her with a few viable options for sneaking away from them. On the other hand, if the cargo ship called in support from other Authority warships, they could be in a lot of trouble quickly. 

By the time she had smoked down this cigarillo, Hemi had already reported twice that there had been no change in their pursuer's course or speed. They would be directly over the *Prospect's* position in a matter of minutes.

As she tossed the snuffed butt at the can, one of the radios mounted to the ceiling of the compartment above her head suddenly lit up and started squawking noisily. Everyone in the control room jumped.

[//]: # (I think they cargo ship would have to have their engines off to use ship-to-ship... check above to see if you said they restarted them.)

"To the submerged submarine: You are ordered to surface and pop hatches and prepare for inspection. This order is given under the authority of the Alliance of Northern Empires..."

"Shit... they are close enough for ship-to-ship radio? We're fucked." Said Owen.

"Shut the fuck up." Said Bastian.

"Percy's eyes tracked the bouncing signal needle on the ship-to-ship radio unit. "...tracked you from a port known for contraband logistics. You are suspected of hauling parts that could be utilized as weapons or weapons components by enemies of the Alliance of Northern Empires. If you do not immediately begin surfacing procedures, further measures will be taken against you up to and including the use of deadly force and the recruitment of more significant anti-submarine forces to use against your ship. ...Message repeats..." Percy dialed down the volume on the radio.

"Weapons?" Owen asked skeptically, "I thought we were hauling a shipment of wristwatches?"

"Indeed we are." Said Percy. "The only trouble is the watches are going to the Independent Island Pact forces... for distribution to infantry who need them to time artillery strikes."

"Hardly *weapons* though..." Said Owen.

"It does explain why we have a converted freighter tailing us though." Said Bastian. "If we were hauling actual weapons, they'd have a destroyer over us right now raining down charges on our delicate fucking heads."

"It hardly fucking matters." Said Percy. "We could be hauling blankets and bandaids, if they know our deliver is to their enemies in the Island Pact, they will seize the cargo, probably our whole boat. We'll likely end up in non-combatant detention... where at least we won't be tortured."

"So what are we going to do Captain?" Asked Owen.

"We're going to do what a submarine does best Owen: run and fucking hide." She picked the mic off the ship-to-ship radio and put it to her lips before keying the transmit button. "Ship on the surface, this is submerged sub. Acknowledged receipt of transmission. Preparing to surface, please stand by."

Percy reached up and replaced the mic on its peg before snapping off the power to the ship-to-ship radio.

"We're going to dive?" Bastian asked, his hand raising towards the valves that would flood the main ballast in anticipation of Percy's next move.

"Hold that fuckin' hand Bastian. If we flood the tanks they'll probably hear it and know we're going down not up. Owen, give us five knots forward. Bastian, full down plane. This way the won't know if we're driving up towards them or downwards away from them."

Bastian nodded as he turned the dive-plane control wheel full over to its stop. They could hear the muffled whine as the electric motors wound up down in the engine room in response to Owen's forward push of the throttle levers. A gentle momentum game on the boat. Accompanied by the sinking bow driven down by the angle of the dive planes.

"It won't be long before they figure out we're moving away from them." Said Owen doubtfully.

"Fucking trust your Captain Owen." Said Percy. "It's not like I haven't been driving subs for decades now is it?" She was counting softly to herself. "OK, twenty degrees port rudder Owen. Make it look like we're going to execute a Williamson turn or something, like we'll come back around to meet them at their position."

Owen hand-over-handed the rudder wheel around, and the boat leaned over to the left in response.

Percy kept counting and then stepped forward between the two men at the control chairs. One of her arms stretched across Owen's body, and he leaned back to give her room to maneuver the boat herself. She reached a count of which she was the only person in the control room who was aware of the significance of, and then she eased back on the throttle levers to the zero notch.

The boat went silent, still gliding forward under inertia, the bow still pointed down to the depths.

Percy put her right hand on the rudder wheel and her left on the dive-plane control wheel. Her eyes tracked the depth gauge and the pitch gauge. She backed the dive-plane control wheel until the boat was not in quite such a steep dive. Then she turned the rudder hard around to starboard, and felt her boat swing in response. She started a new count under her breath.

She reached one-hundred and twenty before she swung the rudder back around to some point to port. She stepped back, still watching the depth gauge.

At 190 meters she said "level us off Bastian."

He put his hands on the dive-plane control wheel and adjusted it gently back and a little forth until the boat was sitting level.

"Let her drift boys." Percy said. She switched the lighting to red night-time lighting so no one would forget the tenuousness of their situation. "With any luck we'll have slipped under a thermocline and this cold deep water will make it much harder for them to hear us."

She slid down the ladder and stood behind Cassandra and Hemi. Hemi pulled an earphone back and looked at her.

"Just keep listening Hemi. Tell me what they are doing."

Hemi nodded.

"And.. definitely keep an ear out for any new contacts. They worst thing that could happen to use right now is they make good on their threat and bring in support."

Hemi nodded again and replaced the earpiece. The pads of this big fingers settled into place on the sonar direction control wheel and scanned back and forth across the contact.

Captain Percy stepped back and leaned against the navigation table. She pulled yet another cigarillo from her pocket and lit it. Its orange glow fluorescing more brightly red than the red lighting that bathed her. She smoked slowly, estimating that about the time she completed the cigarillo --- having heard no response on the ship-to-ship and not sighted the *Prospect* on the surface --- their hunters above would begin to suspect she had no intention of surfacing.

She sucked the coal down until it burned against the back of her fingers. She stubbed the tiny bit out in a pinching motion against her boot and tossed it into the can at Hemi's feet. She put a hand on his shoulder. "What are they up to Hemi?"

"They have started their engines again. They are circling very slowly."

"Bah. Fuck that, the morons. They'll never hear anything with the diesels running, even slowly."

"Yes. I assume their plan is to stop and listen at intervals."

Percy settled in. She calmly paced the length of the sonar compartment for the next half hour, silently chain-smoking except for the occasional check-ins with Hemi. With a few notes on bearings scratched onto a pad with a pencil, Hemi soon established that the ship above them was searching with a slowly growing figure-8 pattern that revolved around and centered on the spot they had last contact with the *Prospect*. They were stopping every few minutes --- though with a deliberately random frequency in the hopes of catching the *Prospect* in the act of motoring away --- to listen on their sonar unit.

[//]: # (Here begins the ticking watches section)

Percy was not willing to take the risk of motoring away, at least not yet. They had put 1000 meters or so between themselves and the point the ship above had contact with them by their first move. When the ship was at their furthest apogee of their figure-8 pattern, they were now almost a quarter nautical mile away. Percy figured that with patience an opportunity to sneak away silently would inevitably present itself.

She tapped Hemi on the shoulder. "Go get us some coffee Hemi, I don't want anyone falling asleep." This was true, but she also knew operating the sonar was mind-numbing work, and even a few minutes off the headset would have Hemi back sharper than before. As he rose, she took the headset from him and sat down in the chair next to Cassandra.

She let Cassandra do the operating. It would be bad practice to take over when she didn't have the full picture of the sound environment around her boat. Cassandra was carefully tracking the bearing of the ship's engines, now only a little more than 1000 meters off as they approached the closest point in their search pattern. It was only a few tens of seconds after Percy sat down that the engines went silent. Cassandra took advantage of the pause in their search and the silence it yielded to scan around and search for any new contacts. She slowly turned the directional control wheel of the sonar around, her eyes closed, listening intently.

Suddenly she opened her big eyes and looked at Percy. "What's that?" She whispered almost to herself. 

Percy turned up the volume on her headset. "I don't hear anything." Percy said. The younger woman had phenomenal ears, and Percy knew that.

"Directly towards out bow. It's some kind of regular clicking."

"Not a new contact then?"

"Could be... but that doesn't feel right. Maybe something organic... like a dolphin or something." Cassandra picked up Hemi's pencil and tapped it lightly against the steel of the directional wheel in time to what she was hearing. It was a rapid beat with an irregular pattern:

.... ...... ...  .... ..... ....... .. .....


She tapped away vigorously. After a minute the patter had started to shift:

..... ..... .... ..... .... ...... ....

Hemi returned with the coffee and looked questioningly at Cassandra's pencil drumming.

Percy stood up, handing him back the headset as she took a hot tin cup of coffee from him. "Cassandra says she's got something weird. Certainly not like anything I've ever heard described before. You should definitely listen to it with your expert ears Hemi."

Hemi put the headset on and watched Cassandra's pencil work. The pattern was steadily shifting, becoming more defined:

... ... .... ... ... ... .... ... .. ... ...

Hemi listened for a few seconds.

"What is that Hemi?" Percy asked.

"I believe it is..."

"I know what it is..." said Cassandra. "It's the wristwatches in the hold, ticking."

"Can't fucking be... there's no way they would be so loud. And they would have wound down in storage."

Hemi was listening intently. "No... Sylvia, I believe Cassandra is correct. The watches may have been wound up by some of the motion of the boat... and improbable as it may be, the ticking is slowly coming into alignment --- a single wristwatch would never be loud enough to be heard, but crates and crates of them --- if they were all ticking precisely at the same rate --- could potentially be heard on the sonar..."

"Could potentially give us the fuck away Hemi! What are the fucking chances? This is some vengeful wrath-out-of-hell level shit. Like the rules of the games, strategy and cunning, don't fucking matter an iota if shit like this is going to happen to us!"

"Randomness often aligns to some kind of order." Said Hemi.

"What do we do?" Cassandra asked.

"Call upon patience and luck." Said Hemi. "Order can arise from randomness, but entropy will re-assert itself eventually."

Cassandra key tapping, the beats coming together into a regular rhythm:

.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.

Percy watched the signal strength indicator on the sonar unit. With each pulse, it climbed a little higher. There was some point --- she could hardly guess where --- that it would cross into an amplitude that the sonar operator on the ship above them would be able to hear.

.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.

In the old days many submariners and sailors had been devoutly religious. It made sense: in a world of huge external forces, it was helpful to believe that one of those huge forces could be brought over to your side. "But," Percy thought to herself, "what kind of irony is it that now I need the forced of chaos to save us? I'm pretty sure no old sailor ever called on their got to impost chaos and disorder on their lives to save them from what appeared to be some kind of incredibly unlikely and potentially divine and wrathful order."

.
.
.
.
..

"I've got a double-beat." Said Cassandra.

"That is almost certainly the beginning of the end of it..." Said Hemi.

"Keep tapping for me Cassandra." Said Percy.

.
..
.
.
..
.
.
...
..
.

The beats slowly incorporated a chaotic rhythm into their pattern. And as each tick asserted its independence, the signal lost power.

..
...
..
....
..
.
.....
....
...
..

"The ship on the surface has started their engines again." Said Cassandra. She swung the sonar direction over to the bearing of the engine noise.

"Can you still hear the watches?"

"No. Not at all." Said Hemi.

"Captain Percy..." Cassandra was listening carefully to the headset.

"What? More fucking bad news?"

"No... in fact it seems like we are quite a bit further from the contact than when they stopped their engines... nearly a quarter mile now."

"We must have picked up a strong current in the depth Sylvia." Said Hemi.

"So if we sit tight, we will float right away from those fuckers."

"That seems right." Said Hemi.

"Or, you might say randomness and chaos saved our ass twice in a matter of minutes."

She lit a cigarillo and climbed to the control room. She smoked it down slowly while staring at the unmoving gauges on the wall in front of her."
