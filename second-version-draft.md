# Subworld Short Story #1 -- Second version


A cup of coffee appeared in the space before her eyes, suspended by the rim from Hemi's thick fingertips. The skin of of his fingers were dry and cracked, each crack lined in black from grease that seemed unlikely to ever be completely scrubbed away. "Captain Percy is going to shut down the diesels in a minute so you can have a listen."

She took the metal cup and realized that Hemi had been carefully holding it by the rim because the metal was scalding hot. She gingerly moved it from one hand to the other, and then blew on the surface, sending the small chunks of gray creamer that had remained undissolved scampering.

"I'll be happy for the silence." She said. "When we're running on diesel that flat, unchanging noise of the engines passes through my whole body. It goes right through my skull. It washes out any possibility of thought. My nerves vibrate until they feel nothing. It makes me feel like I'm slipping out of existence."

"That is why I brought you coffee."

She sipped at the coffee, and then set it on the shallow sill in front of her, among the thousands of coffee rings that had preceded this particular cup. She powered up the equipment in front of her and slipped the headphones over her ears.

There was a rush of noise -- the microphones were overwhelmed by the diesels that were still running. Her fingers found the filter switches and the volume controls and she shut down the wash of sound in her ears until there was more ambient sound in the room from the diesel engines than in her headset. The stack of gauges on the wall in front of her eyes still showed by their shaking needles that the sound detection equipment continued to be overwashed by engine noise. Her eyes scanned the needles for a few minutes, but then silence passed like a wave through the compartment and all the needles dropped down to near their zero pins.

Captain Percy's voice floated down from the control room above the compartment she was in. "Casandra?"

"I'm doing a sweep Captain Percy." Her fingertips reversed the settings from a moment ago, and the signal in her headset grew louder. It remained a white-noise hiss, but Cassandra could hear a spatial quality in it. She could hear which way was was up --- the surface waves were coming through --- and she could hear which direction the mics were facing by the way the water slid along the hull versus the sharper crack of the waves hitting the bow.

Her fingertips came to rest on the top of the smooth steel curve of the directional control wheel, and she slowly rotated her mics around. Her eyes continually scanned over the instrumentation --- occasionally the electronic meters could catch a signal before her ears did. But that was rare. Her primary equipment was the headphones. The sounds that came through painted a picture of the surrounding water for her. All the gauges and dials were supplemental to that picture that was in her head.
