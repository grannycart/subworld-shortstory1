	* First draft of an all-Cassandra/sonar set story. Starts with sonar and skips the radar chase section. 
* [rough-draft_from-typed-version.md](./rough-draft_from-typed-version.md)
	* This was the first version, typed on the typewriter and then entered as an .md file
	* Includes a long chase scene, mostly set on the bridge (could be used in another story since it isn't really connected in any way to the sonar scenes)
	* Also the first draft version of listening to the watches ticking through the sonar.
