# Subworld Short Story #1 -- Second version

[//]: # (Think of the story as a sculpture.)

A cup of coffee appeared in the space before her eyes, suspended from thick fingertips by the rim of the cup. The skin of of those fingers were dry and cracked, each crack lined in black from grease that seemed unlikely to ever be completely scrubbed away. She took the metal cup from and realized that it was too hot to be held by anything but the rim. She moved it from one hand to the other, and then brought it up to send a pursed-lip cooling breath across the surface. Small chunks of gray creamer that had remained undissolved scattered across the rippling off-white liquid. 

She sipped at the coffee. It was too hot to have any taste. She set the cup on the shallow sill in front of her, among the thousands of rings that had preceded this particular cup --- a pattern of randomness that seemed to still be intentional somehow. She powered up the equipment in front of her and slipped the headphones over her ears.

There was a rush of noise --- the microphones were overwhelmed by the sound of the diesel engines that shook the steel walls and penetrated to every corner of the compartment. Her fingertips found the filter switches and volume knobs without looking for them, and she shut down the wash of sound in her ears until the ambient sound in the room from the diesel engines was louder than in her headset. The stack of gauges on the wall in front of her eyes still showed by their energized and quavering needles that the sound detection equipment continued to be overwashed by engine noise. Her eyes scanned the needles for a few seconds, but then silence passed like a wave through the compartment and all the needles dropped down to hover near their zero pins.

The silence was the signal for her to go to work. Her fingertips reversed the settings from a moment ago, and the signal in her headset grew louder as she increased the gain. The sound remained a white-noise hiss, but where the noise of the diesel engines had been flat and featureless, now she could hear a spatial quality. The sound expanded around her. She knew from previous instruction that she could hear for miles and miles underwater. And experience had trained her mind to shift into a mode where she understood the particular hiss she now had in her headphones as depth --- miles and miles of depth in every direction that she pointed her microphones.

The sound also had a direction to it. From the surface above came the unique and subtly varying roll and hiss of the waves, which gave her a sense of "up." And those waves also slide along the hull in a particular way, so her mind knew from the sound alone when the mics were pointed out to one side or the other of the boat. The bow also created a unique cracking sound against the waves, so her ears knew which was was forward as well.

The pads of her fingers rested on the top of the smooth steel curve of the directional control wheel with its hard little finger-bumps molded into it. Outside the boat, the mics slowly rotated around with the turning wheel. She scanned her eyes over the instrumentation --- occasionally the electronic indicators could catch a signal before her ears did. But that was rare. Her primary equipment was the headphones. The sounds that came through painted a picture of the surrounding water for her. All the gauges and dials were supplemental to that picture that was in her head, like an engraved image that accompanied the text of a novel. 

After a couple of passes, she was sure there was nothing nearby but empty water. Now she engaged some of the electronic filters that did a reasonable job of cutting down the frequencies of the sounds that came from the surface chop. This is where the more sophisticated electronics of the sonar rig could occasionally shine --- by filtering out specific frequencies she could focus in on more distant and dimmer sounds. Her ear interpreted the shift in white-noise hiss of sound as the filters came online as listening further out. Scanning further out meant turning the directional wheel more slowly, since she was covering much greater distances. A careful scan at maximum range could take her ten minutes or more. The biggest challenge was remaining focused on the unchanging sound in her ears. The hovering little signal-strength gauges did help with that by giving her something to look at while scanning with her ears. Still, she often closed her eyes and would immerse herself in the slowly-shifting passes of ocean white noise. Often it seemed she could feel the long-amplitude heave of the big global swells that passed her by, like giant parents stepping over small sleeping children with a fear of waking them.

She took a sip of her coffee. It barely retained any heat, and now she could taste the caked char of the over-roasted stale coffee grounds spreading like an icing across her tongue on the chemical catalyst of the artificial creamer. Those damn metal cups: burn-your-fingers hot when the coffee is first poured, and always cold by the second sip.

With one hand on the directional wheel, she rolled the microphones past the direction of the stern. The slightest extra whir in her ears told her to pause for a second as the microphones passed just to the side of their stern. She returned her coffee cup to the sill with its forest of brown rings and curled the fingers of both her hands around the directional wheel.

She closed her eyes and with barely perceptible movements turned the directional wheel back and forth across the bearing where she thought she had heard the distant whir. There was nothing. And then maybe there was something. Without opening her eyes she moved a hand to flip some adjusting switches that enabled and disable various frequency gains. The hiss in her headphone changed with the switches --- slightly fewer higher frequencies, more rushing low notes. 

As if sensing something, the control room requested a report from her. "Anything on the sonar Cassandra?"

"Quiet." An order, not a report. The sonar operator was not in control of the boat, but her job was so critical that she retained the prerogative to give single-word commands that yielded the most ideal conditions in which to operate her rig.

The directional wheel slipped between her fingers. Back and forth, inching across the location of the signal. The sound there was just strong enough to register on some of the more sensitive gauges, popping the thin black needle up a few ticks each time the mics passed over the sound. To her ears it sounded like some kind of distant music, the hum and thrum of an orchestra heard through marble walls and from down a city block. But she knew what the sound really was: a ship.

She slipped one headphone off an ear and leaned back in her chair to call up through the hatch to the control room. "I've got a contact."

Hemi --- he of the thick fingers that had brought her the coffee earlier --- slipped his bulk down the steel ladder and stepped up to the sonar rig. As he put the second set of headphones over his ears, Cassandra rolled the directional control wheel back and forth, and pointed to the signal popping up on the indicator gauges. Hemi listened for a minute and then nodded to her. "Alright. Nice work. That signal is barely there. I am sure it is too far off for us to get an accurate distance from the ranging equipment, and too far to see from the lookout ring. But we know what direction to look in. I will speak to Sylvia and see if she wants to re-start the diesels."

Cassandra nodded and returned her attention to her contact. A minute latter she heard the popping whine of compressed air turning over the diesels. She winced and yanked the headset off her ears before the diesels fired and washed out all the ambient noise in both the compartment and her headset.

Hemi returned and tapped her shoulder. "Sylvia wants to run on diesels to try to out-distance that contact. Her plan is to stop the diesels every twenty minutes or so, and let you have a listen on the sonar."

"Obviously she wants to know if we lose the contact, or if they gain on us."

"Also see if you can calculate their heading. It would be useful to know if they are going in the same direction as us, or just happened to wander into your sonar range."

"Alright Hemi." 

Hemi climbed the ladder back up to the control room.

Cassandra pulled the headphones off her head and hung them on the peg. She leaned back, crossed her arms, and closed her eyes. There was nothing for her to do until the diesels stopped. She tried to let her mind relax. She tried not to hear the penetrating drone of the diesel engines, but they were loud enough that she felt like they had swallowed her whole body. Unlike on a surface ship and some other sub, the diesels on this submarine had no direct drive to the props. Instead they just acted as huge generators when they were running --- at the same time charging the boat's batteries and generating electricity that powered the huge electric motors that turned the props. Due to this configuration, the diesels were set to run at one consistent RPM range that was most efficient for generating electricity. This meant that no matter how fast or slow the boat was going, no matter if they were plowing through heavy seas or making good time on a smooth surface, there was never any variation in the intensity of the diesels. To Cassandra's ears they felt like they were just all-on, all the time when they were running. She found it disconcerting to not be able to associate the motion of the boat with the pitch of the engines. That was on top of the fact that the engine noise was loud enough to make her sonar rig all but useless. She wished there was a way for the submarine to run on its nearly-silent batteries all the time.

Since darkness had fallen hours ago, the compartment was lit up with the red night lighting. The glow of it penetrated through her closed eyelids. Half dozed off in her chair, she imagined the color of the red lights was somehow an exact visual representation of the unceasing and penetrating drone of the diesel engines. Like she had been entirely enveloped in some hellscape of noise and light.

The thought floated through her dazed mind that she could ask Captain Percy to switch on the red lights. But as the thought came up, Hemi was shaking her shoulder and she sat upright. The diesels died away. It was her turn to work again.

The headset went back on. She immediately turned the microphones to the bearing of the sound she had detected earlier. It was still there. Had it changed? Increased in amplitude? Her ears said maybe, but that was based on a memory of the sound from 20 minutes earlier. If it had gotten stronger, the change was still within the wavering variation of the signal-strength needle, which was not registering any further along the graduated scale than before. With a dull pencil nub she scratched out a note on a piece of scrap paper clipped to the sill with her coffee cup. She put down the signal strength and the bearing, and a few cryptic marks of her own private notation about the quality of the sound and what direction she thought it might be headed in. To be thorough, she swung the microphones in a full 360-degree scan to make sure there were no other surprise signals popping up out there in the expanse of water she could hear surrounding her.

"Signal unchanged." She reported upwards to the control room above her. A moment later the compressed air system hissed and the diesels rolled up to their usual all-engulfing sound. Cassandra returned the sonar headset to the peg and closed her eyes again.

Twenty more minutes passed and she repeated this process. Then another twenty minutes. And another. Each time the signal behind stubbornly refused to have much change to its characteristics. But the unchanging nature of the sound already told her something. "Signal remains unchanged." She reported. "Therefore they must be on, or close to, our own course."

"And you can't determine range?"

"No. The signal is at the very limits of detectability with sonar. Roughly, that puts the range at something like 12-15 nautical miles." According to the readings off the gauges, the signal had no change in characteristics in the last hour she had been tracking it. But looking over her notation, Cassandra was concerned by what her instincts were telling her about the subtle qualities of the sound. She took this last minute of silence before the diesels started again to listen deeply to the signal. To her ear it felt like the sound of powerful engines. And it felt like the prop wash was moving away from her, meaning the ship was moving towards her. No serious sonar operator would claim to be able to hear that kind of detail at the distance she was listening at, but Cassandra felt there were both signal qualities that were empirically verifiable --- the stuff detected by the gauges on the wall, the stuff that could be reported to one's captain --- and then there were signal qualities that were understood more instinctively. These were the things that she made her private little marks about.

Her instincts were telling her that this signal was tracking them.

The diesels started again and blew away any further consideration of the signal for the time being. It was only a few minutes later when Cassandra heard a mild commotion in the control room above. Captain Percy was shouting questions up to the topside bridge --- presumably to Hemi, or whoever else might be up in the lookout ring. Since the questions were directed upwards, Cassandra could not make out what was being discussed.

The drone of the diesels was suddenly punctuated by the sound of water rushing through the pipes that lined the walls of the sonar compartment. Cassandra sensed a sinking motion in the boat. Were they diving? The motion gradual and slight --- not a dive then. After a few seconds of flushing in the pipes, she could hear a change in the sound of the water that ran along the hull, now it was muted and flowing where previously it had been slapping and rushing with a more chaotic energy.

Hemi came back down the ladder. "The lookouts finally got a shadow of your sonar contact in sight against the horizon. Captain Percy is up on the bridge making observations. She was not pleased with the profile of your contact: it has a militant shape to it."

"And you lowered the boat to create less of a radar profile?"

"Correct. We are running sail-out now. Though that likely means we lost the visual back over the horizon since we are lower in the water. The plan is to continue to give you an opportunity to listen every twenty minutes or so."

Cassandra nodded. Lowering the boat would make their boat more difficult to track on radar while still allowing them to run at the higher speeds provided by the powerful diesels over the electric motors running on batteries. But it also put more of the diesels engine noise underwater, they may in fact be easier to track on sonar now.

The next time the diesels shut down, Cassandra quickly found the contact and could clearly see that the signal had gained strength --- meaning it had closed some of the distance between them.

"Signal strengthened since last contact." She reported up to the control room. She took a grease pencil and made a mark on the signal-strength gauge at the point where the needle now stood quivering. "Still too far to estimate range with any precision."

The increased signal strength was unfortunate but not unexpected. If the ship behind was tracking them on radar, then seeing the radar signal weaken or disappear would spur them to close the distance to the point where they lost contact. Cassandra no longer had any doubt that they were being pursued. Speed was not the submarine's strong suit. If their pursuers were some kind of official or military vessel, they were going to overrun the submarine eventually. If they must lose these pursuers, other tactics would be required.  But it was likely Captain Percy was hoping to make it to dawn before employing those tactics.

For the next four hours it was start and stop with the diesels. Cassandra tracked the two vessels in her head from nothing but the sounds in her ears and the marks in her notes and on her gauges. 

Each time the diesels stopped, Hemi would slide down the ladder, take her readings and mark down the relative positions of the two vessels on the navigation chart. When Cassandra looked at the chart she was pleased to see the hash marks coincided precisely with what she was holding in her mind's eye. But Hemi's hash marks marched steadily towards each other across the chart. There was no question that their pursuers were gaining on them.

"This is unproductive Hemi. We can keep the wheels turning at full RPMs, and they can chase us across the open ocean for days. Eventually they will catch us though, don't you think?

"There is no question about it. It would not be days. Look at the math: they would catch us before noon tomorrow. Even in the days when ships had sails it was often just a matter of physics in a chase. Two ships rig for their fastest possible speeds, and the faster ship --- even if just slightly faster --- would eventually win out. It is not like a footrace where there is no telling the endurance of the other person."

"But that is where we can take advantage of being a submarine --- we have other options we can employ."

"We will dive sometime in the next hour, I think." Said Hemi. "I am sure Captain Percy will want to get under before the dawn light rises."
