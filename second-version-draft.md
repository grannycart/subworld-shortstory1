# Subworld Short Story #1 -- Second version

[//]: # (Think of the story as a sculpture.)

A cup of coffee appeared in the space before her eyes, suspended from thick fingertips by the rim of the cup. The skin of of those fingers were dry and cracked, each crack lined in black from grease that seemed unlikely to ever be completely scrubbed away. She took the metal cup from and realized that it was too hot to be held by anything but the rim. She moved it from one hand to the other, and then brought it up to send a pursed-lip cooling breath across the surface. Small chunks of gray creamer that had remained undissolved scattered across the rippling off-white liquid. 

She sipped at the coffee. It was too hot to have any taste. She set the cup on the shallow sill in front of her, among the thousands of rings that had preceded this particular cup --- a pattern of randomness that seemed to still be intentional somehow. She powered up the equipment in front of her and slipped the headphones over her ears.

There was a rush of noise --- the microphones were overwhelmed by the sound of the diesel engines that shook the steel walls and penetrated to every corner of the compartment. Her fingertips found the filter switches and volume knobs without looking for them, and she shut down the wash of sound in her ears until the ambient sound in the room from the diesel engines was louder than in her headset. The stack of gauges on the wall in front of her eyes still showed by their energized and quavering needles that the sound detection equipment continued to be overwashed by engine noise. Her eyes scanned the needles for a few seconds, but then silence passed like a wave through the compartment and all the needles dropped down to hover near their zero pins.

The silence was the signal for her to go to work. Her fingertips reversed the settings from a moment ago, and the signal in her headset grew louder as she increased the gain. The sound remained a white-noise hiss, but where the noise of the diesel engines had been flat and featureless, now she could hear a spatial quality. The sound expanded around her. She knew from previous instruction that she could hear for miles and miles underwater. And experience had trained her mind to shift into a mode where she understood the particular hiss she now had in her headphones as depth --- miles and miles of depth in every direction that she pointed her microphones.

The sound also had a direction to it. From the surface above came the unique and subtly varying roll and hiss of the waves, which gave her a sense of "up." And those waves also slide along the hull in a particular way, so her mind knew from the sound alone when the mics were pointed out to one side or the other of the boat. The bow also created a unique cracking sound against the waves, so her ears knew which was was forward as well.

The pads of her fingers rested on the top of the smooth steel curve of the directional control wheel with its hard little finger-bumps molded into it. Outside the boat, the mics slowly rotated around with the turning wheel. She scanned her eyes over the instrumentation --- occasionally the electronic indicators could catch a signal before her ears did. But that was rare. Her primary equipment was the headphones. The sounds that came through painted a picture of the surrounding water for her. All the gauges and dials were supplemental to that picture that was in her head, like an engraved image that accompanied the text of a novel. 

After a couple of passes, she was sure there was nothing nearby but empty water. Now she engaged some of the electronic filters that did a reasonable job of cutting down the frequencies of the sounds that came from the surface chop. This is where the more sophisticated electronics of the sonar rig could occasionally shine --- by filtering out specific frequencies she could focus in on more distant and dimmer sounds. Her ear interpreted the shift in white-noise hiss of sound as the filters came online as listening further out. Scanning further out meant turning the directional wheel more slowly, since she was covering much greater distances. A careful scan at maximum range could take her ten minutes or more. The biggest challenge was remaining focused on the unchanging sound in her ears. The hovering little signal-strength gauges did help with that by giving her something to look at while scanning with her ears. Still, she often closed her eyes and would immerse herself in the slowly-shifting passes of ocean white noise. Often it seemed she could feel the long-amplitude heave of the big global swells that passed her by, like giant parents stepping over small sleeping children with a fear of waking them.

She took a sip of her coffee. It barely retained any heat, and now she could taste the caked char of the over-roasted stale coffee grounds spreading like an icing across her tongue on the chemical catalyst of the artificial creamer. Those damn metal cups: burn-your-fingers hot when the coffee is first poured, and always cold by the second sip.

With one hand on the directional wheel, she rolled the microphones past the direction of the stern. The slightest extra whir in her ears told her to pause for a second as the microphones passed just to the side of their stern. She returned her coffee cup to the sill with its forest of brown rings and curled the fingers of both her hands around the directional wheel.

She closed her eyes and with barely perceptible movements turned the directional wheel back and forth across the bearing where she thought she had heard the distant whir. There was nothing. And then maybe there was something. Without opening her eyes she moved a hand to flip some adjusting switches that enabled and disable various frequency gains. The hiss in her headphone changed with the switches --- slightly fewer higher frequencies, more rushing low notes. 

As if sensing something, the control room requested a report from her. "Anything on the sonar Cassandra?"

"Quiet." An order, not a report. The sonar operator was not in control of the boat, but her job was so critical that she retained the prerogative to give single-word commands in order to get the most ideal conditions in which to operate her rig.
