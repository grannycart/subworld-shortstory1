# Subworld Short Story #1 -- Second version, revision #1


A cup of coffee appeared in the empty space before her eyes, suspended by the rim from the tips of thick fingers. The skin on those fingers was dry, and it cracked in places it circles callous. Each crack was lined in black where years of exposure to various greasy substances had worked its way in. 

The cup was made of stamped and rolled metal, the outside coated in a dipped rubber. The rubber coating was also cracked and worn away in places much like the fingers above.

She took the cup and the fingers withdrew from her line of vision. She realized the cup was too hot to be held by anything but the rim or the little handle. She moved it from one hand to the other, holding it by the handle with the ends of her thin fingers, and brought it up to send a pursed-lip cooling breath across the surface. Small chunks of gray creamer that had remained undissolved scattered across the rippling gray liquid. 

She sipped at the coffee. It was too hot to have any taste. She set the cup on the shallow wooden sill in front of her, among the thousands of rings that had preceded this particular cup -- a pattern that was clearly random yet retained a suggestion of intention. She flipped a metal switch powering up the equipment in front of her and slipped the headphones over her ears.

There was a rush of noise -- the microphones were overwhelmed by the sound of the diesel engines that shook the steel walls and penetrated to every corner of the compartment. Her fingertips found the filter switches and volume knobs by rote muscle memory, and she shut down the wash of sound in her ears until the ambient sound in the room from the diesel engines was louder than in her headset. The stack of gauges on the wall in front of her still showed by their quavering needles that the sound detection equipment continued to be overwashed by engine noise. Her eyes scanned the needles for a few seconds, but then silence passed like a wave through the compartment and all the needles dropped down to hover near their zero pins.

The silence was the signal for her to go to work. Her fingertips reversed the settings from a moment ago, and the signal in her headset grew louder as she increased the gain. The sound remained a white-noise hiss, but where the diesel engines had given off a flat and featureless roar, now she could hear an additional spatial quality. The sound expanded around her. She knew from experience that she could hear for miles underwater. And experience had trained her mind to shift into a mode where she understood the particular hiss she now had in her headphones as depth -- a huge expanse of a fat column of water in every direction she pointed her microphones.

The sound also had a direction to it. From the surface above came the unique and subtly varying roll and hiss of the waves, which gave her a sense of "up." And those waves also slid along the hull in a particular way, so her mind knew from the sound alone if the microphones were aimed out to one side or the other of the boat. The bow also created the unique sound of waves cracking and splitting against it. So her ears knew which was was forward as well.

The pads of her fingers rested on the top of the smooth steel curve of the small wheel with its hard little finger-sized bumps molded into it. The wheel controlled the direction the underwater microphones pointed. Outside the boat, the microphones slowly rotated around with the turning of the wheel. She scanned her eyes over the instrumentation -- occasionally the electronic indicators could catch a signal before her ears did. But that was rare. Her primary equipment was the headphones. The sounds that came through transmitted a picture of the surrounding water to her. All the gauges and dials were supplemental to the picture in her head, like an engraved image that accompanied the text of a novel. 

After a couple of passes, she was sure there was nothing nearby but empty water. Now she engaged some of the electronic filters that did a reasonable job of cutting down the frequencies of the sounds that came from the surface chop. This is where the more sophisticated electronics of the sonar rig could occasionally shine -- by filtering out specific frequencies she could focus in on more distant and dimmer sounds. Her ear interpreted the shift in the white-noise hiss of sound as the filters came online as listening further out. Scanning further out meant turning the directional wheel more slowly, since she was covering much greater distances. A careful scan at maximum range could take her ten minutes or more. The biggest challenge was remaining focused on the unchanging sound in her ears. The hovering little signal-strength gauges did help with that by giving her something to look at while searching with her ears. Still, she often closed her eyes and would immerse herself in the slowly-shifting passes of ocean noise. Often it seemed she could feel the long-amplitude heave of the big global swells that passed her by, like giant parents gingerly stepping over small sleeping children in fear of waking them.

She took a sip of her coffee. It barely retained any heat, and now she could taste the caked char of the over-roasted stale coffee grounds spreading like an icing across her tongue, buoyed by the chemical catalyst of the artificial creamer. Those damn metal cups: burn-your-fingers hot when the coffee is first poured, and always cold by the second sip.

With one hand on the directional wheel, she rolled the microphones past the stern. The slightest extra whir in her ears told her to pause for a second as the microphones passed just to the side of their stern. She returned her coffee cup to the sill with its forest of brown rings and curled the fingers of both her hands around grip of the directional wheel.
