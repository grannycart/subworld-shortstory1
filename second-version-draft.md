# Subworld Short Story #1 -- Second version


A cup of coffee appeared in the space before her eyes, suspended by the rim from Hemi's thick fingertips. The skin of of his fingers were dry and cracked, each crack lined in black from grease that seemed unlikely to ever be completely scrubbed away. She took the metal cup and realized that Hemi had been carefully holding it by the rim because the metal was scalding hot. She gingerly moved it from one hand to the other, and then blew on the surface, sending the small chunks of gray creamer that had remained undissolved scampering.

"I hate radar watch Hemi." Her eyes tracked the radar sweep as it once again went over the top of the circular screen and crept towards the bottom.

"It can certainly be mind-numbing. But it is not difficult."

"It's not just the radar screen though. When we're running on diesel that flat, unchanging noise of the engines just goes through everything. It goes right through my skull. It washes out any possibility of thought. It vibrates my nerves until they feel nothing. And then the radar is like a visual representation of that nothingness. Radar watch makes me feel like I'm slipping out of existence."

"That is why I brought you coffee."

With one hand she sipped at the coffee that was still too hot to have any taste. The fingers of her other hand came up and intuitively found the control switches of the radar unit. She adjusted the range and trimmed the scope until the sweeping line was more sharply defined. Without conscious thought her fingertips touched the switch to check that the audio alert was engaged. She leaned back, to the extent that she could in the uncomfortable fixed steel chair.
