# Subworld Short Story #1 -- Rough Draft From As-Typed Version



Contrary to conventional notions, the oceans of our world are in fact vast slow-moving cauldrons of pitch and oil. A viscous and black liquid into which the light of the sun barely seeps, penetrating only enough to create a dim penumbra glow at the very edges if one were taking the totality of the ocean's mass into account when one considered them. Which is how one should consider the oceans. They are not separate basins slowly dribbling back and forth from one to the other, but a single huge mass of greasy black lubricant, malevolently yanked bodily back and forth by the moon twice a day. The oceans are no some porpoise-filled, cycle-of-life-affirming, three-dimensional, Earth-in-its-natural-state playground, they are the greatest force of never-ending darkness in our world. For that reason we rarely think about them. What oceans actually are is literally out-of-sight, and out of mind.

For most of us.

Pushing their way slowly through the thick blackness are thousands and thousands of objects --- steel tubes with no windows that feel their way by sound alone. These objects, at home in the subconscious medium of the black ocean, are also rarely considered or thought about. They are objects that reside in our cultural subconscious, occupying a mostly forgotten space. That is, in fact the intention of the objects --- to be forgotten as they traverse a forgotten medium. To become conscious of them is for their central function to have failed.

These objects --- 'boats' is the term-of-art, but commonly called submarines --- are mechanical objects. They were built by humans, who spend most of their time wandering the sub-baked, dry crusty parts of the planet, and chose to put the very limits of their mechanical skills to the test to create these objects that would allow them to exist and move through a field where every aspect of their delicate life-requirements needed a mechanical intervention. That is, to pass through liquid death.

The boats are forgotten, but there is no home that does not contain many everyday objects that passed through the hold of one of these machines. They enable the trade and logistics that make our culture of things possible.

While in our surface world trade has ground to a near-halt by the never-ending soft-power bickering and dispute, the cargo submarines and their crews have used their clandestine stealth to make trade possible. Like the liquid ocean rolling back and forth, the cargo submarines have created a subconscious flow of their own --- a kind of beneath-the-consciousness global economic commerce.

The *Prospect* was one of these cargo subs. Roughly a hundred meters long and painted black, its forward half was almost entirely an empty void designed to be loaded up with cargo of any type that could be fit into its hold. A short distance back from the bow of this boat sprang short wings from the side --- the planes that could be angled to control whether the machine moved up or down in the water. About two-thirds of the length back on this steel tube, a large black dorsal fin sprouted up --- the sail --- which attained a height of about seven meters. two-thirds again the height of the main tube of the submarine itself. The top of the sail was inset with a shallow well --- the bridge --- from which the boat could be directed while it was running on the surface.

Which is what it was doing right now. The *Prospect* was a diesel-electric boat --- like nearly all civilian cargo subs and Authority war machines at the time of this story. It generally ran on the surface at night, driven by its powerful diesel engines and charging its batteries at the same time. During the day, it would submerge and run down the battery charge as its nearly-silent electric motors pushed it through the oily depths.

While surfaced at night, Captain Percy generally preferred to be on the bridge at the top of the sail, at least if the weather was anything other than awful. On this particular night Percy smoked through one blunt wrap of tobacco after another, elbows resting on the fairing of the sail, facing the rear of the boat. The tobacco smoke rose up and quickly wafted off into the breeze, dispersed and invisible against the gray star-stuffed night sky.

At the rear of the sail, directly in Captain Percy's gaze, two black fingers rose up into the air above. From the tips of those fingers flames of glowing red, that occasionally brightened to a lush orange, arced up into the sky and were blown backwards by the breeze the boat was charging into. Black soot poured off the end of the flames and climbed up and held in the air, infinite little particles of black that coalesced together and formed into a cloud. The cloud of soot marked the bath of the passing boat, rising up behind it. Unfortunately, it left a signal, a path of breadcrumbs, that other vessels could follow. The *Prospect* cut across the oily surface, writing its history as it went.

Up above Captain Percy in the lookout ring, a huge man --- huge in both girth and height --- had wedged himself. He was holding a large pair of binoculars and slowly completing a 360-degree scan of the black line where the horizon of the ocean met the gray of the sky.

"See anything Hemi?" Captain Percy called up to the big man, more to break up the monotony than because any report was actually needed.

"No Sylvia." He replied. "It is one of those nights where the planes of the sea and the sky look like they have been hammered against each other, and there is no space left for even the tiniest mote to squeeze between them."

Percy pulled at her cigarillo and looked up at the dome of stars above her, made impossibly flat by nothing but the sheer and unfathomable distance. Even with no moon, the stars glowed with a brightness that made the whole sky shine with a celestial light that almost stung the eyes when confronted with the inky unreflective blackness of the sea below.

Half an hour passed in an uninterrupted sensory blackwash. The diesels hummed their unvarying groan-drone, the soles of Percy's boots vibrated, the ocean chop sloshed in a regular pattern along the semi-exposed hull of the boat.

Percy let the second half of her cigarillo burn away between her fingers without remembering to take a puff from it. She was beginning to love the ability to tell whether she was standing on the bridge of her boat or just dreaming it when at the bottom of the ladder at her feet a circular hatch split open and a hellish red glow poured out.

Nothing came through the hatch though except for the voice of a young man, calling up to Percy from the submarine's control room. "Captain Percy, Cassandra says she's got a blip on the radar."

"OK Owen, thanks. What's the range and direction?" She was unconcerned. The oceans were busy and crowded places --- at least on the surface. It would be unusual to make it through a nighttime surface run without encountering at least a few other vessels, even in the remote parts of the world, which this was not particularly.

"The blip is 22 nautical miles --- behind us." There was a pause while more detail was relayed up to Owen from the radar station three decks below where Percy was sanding. "...Almost directly behind us, a little off to the starboard side." 

Percy didn't bother passing the message on up to Hemi, the range was too far to be seen from the lookout ring. Hemi could probably hear what Owen was saying anyway. The contact was well over the horizon. For the moment, there was nothing else Percy could do to divine any further details about this radar blip. But a good cargo-sub driver didn't take unnecessary risks. Better to leave a contact behind than waste any effort trying to identify it. On a cargo sub it was always best to just be left alone, if one could help it. "Owen, push her up to maximum --- 15 knots if she'll do it tonight."

Within the next minute, Percy's keen sense of the motion of her boat told her that they had put on something like 5 more knots of speed, though the pitch of the diesel engines did not change at all. The *Prospect*, like many submarines, was configured for the diesels to always run at the RPMs that produced the maximum efficiency because their job was the generate electricity, not drive the propeller of the boat. That electricity both charged the batteries, and powered the electric motors that did the actual turning of the props. When Owen increased the throttle, the electric motors started spinning faster, but those motors were so quiet relative to the diesel that from the bridge the could not be detected. For anyone used to operating most ships or land vehicles, the changing of velocity without the accompanying change of pitch was one of the many disconcerting things about working on a diesel submarine like the *Prospect*. 

With the boat now going as fast and it was capable of, there was nothing else to do but wait. "Owen, tell Cassandra to keep tracking the blip on radar for now. And you might as well leave the fuckin' hatch open." 

[//]: # (Maybe further develop this idea that for the first part of this story, the scene is up on the bridge, and there are things going on down below the water line in the hull of the boat, but everything that matters comes up to Percy and Hemi on the bridge.)

"Sure Percy." The disembodied voice floated up from below.

Percy list another cigarillo and looked up to catch Hemi's eye when he had lowered the binoculars for a moment. She took the glowing wreath from her lips. "I'm sure I don't fuckin' need to tell you to keep a sharp out behind us?"

"That was indeed my intention Sylvia." Hemi lifted the binoculars and made a slow deliberate scan of the 180 degrees to the rear of the *Prospect*. The black-gray line of the horizon remained as unblemished as it had for the last 24 hours, since they had got out of sight of land after loading up their cargo at the mainland pier they had been docked at.

An hour passed. Percy found that while she had been unintentionally and causally facing the rear of the boat before, now she stood with deliberation at the back of the sail, peering at the trailing wake they left behind them. She let Hemi do the concentrated lookout work, and she focused more on her smoking than watching out behind. At the same time she could not let her gaze wander too long from that black vertical line that always followed off in the distance behind.

Bastian unfolded his thin frame from the hatch and gingerly carried to rubber-coated metal cups of coffee up the ladded to the bridge of the sail. He handed one to Percy and held the other up with his arm fully extended to the long-armed reach of the stooping Hemi. Percy gave Bastian a heartfelt 'thanks.' He just nodded and slithered back down the hole he had come up out of.

Twenty minutes later, Captain Percy though enough time had passed that it was reasonably possible the situation with the radar blip had changed. She cupped a hand around her mouth and called down to Owen in the control room for a report. She could hear her request echoed more faintly down to Cassandra at the radar station deeper within the ship.

[//]: # (Above with Owen relaying might be too quickly repeated from earlier in the story.)

A minute later Owen stood under the open hatch in the ceiling of the control room looking up at her. "Cassandra says the blip is gaining on us Cap. They are at something like twenty nautical miles now."

"Fucking gaining?! Does that mean they are on our heading too?"

A pause, while Owen checked below. "She says she can't tell if they have altered course to follow us, or if they just happen to be going in roughly the same direction. But she is sure they are moving faster than us. If it were someone who is deliberately trying to overtake us, they fucking surely will eventually."

"Eh, fuck Owen, you know we'll dive before we let that happen." She looked up at Hemi. "You better get down there and help Cassandra out on radar, we require a little more fucking precision now than that little waif may be capable of delivering." She turned back to Owen. "Come up and take over for Hemi in the lookout ring Owen."

A minute of sideways scuttling to get past Percy followed --- made slower by Hemi's great bulk --- as Hemi and Owen swapped places on the ship. As Owen moved past her, she warned him: "Be sure to keep a sharp lookout behind --- but don't forget to scan around regularly too Owen."

"I know Captain Percy."

He probably did too. Owen was young, but he was sharp. He wouldn't fuck this up. "Fuckin' good. I'm going down to the control room. You let me know if you see the slightest fuckin' coracle out there, fucking right?"

"I know Captain Percy." Owen said again, with the exact same resolute inflection.

Percy wrapped the toes of her boots around the steel sidebars of the ladder and slid down to the cramped space of the deck below. It could hardly be called a deck, it was just a void inside the sail --- filled with water when they were submerged --- just big enough to let you open and close the hatch to the control room. Holding the hand-grabs, she dangled her boots down into the hatch until they found the familiar perch of the second ladder rung down, and then climbed hand-under-hand down into the red-lit control room.

At the moment, it was just her and Bastian in the small space from which the *Prospect* was run. When the control room had its full complement of Captain Percy, two people at the control seats, and huge Hemi acting in his role as Deck Boss, the small space was extremely crowded. But with auch a small crew managing a 100 meter long boat, it was rare that they had the luxury of everyone in the control room that should be there. Usually it only happened when they need to execute a treacherous maneuver.

Bastian was sitting in the rudder/throttle control chair to the right as one faced the bow of the boat. The planes control seat --- where the angle and depth of the submarine was controlled --- was empty since they didn't need anyone controlling the planes tanks while they ran on the surface. Since the course was set and the throttle at max, Bastian didn't have much to do in the rudder control chair either. He sat looking uncomfortable, with his long legs folded up so he could put his feet on the flat steel panel in front of him and trying to demonstrate a casual, leaned-back pose in the stiffly upright metal chair as he puffed away at a cigarette.

Captain Percy lit another cigarillo off Bastian's coal and reached up to weave her fingers into one of the cracking leather straps that hung above what she considered the "Captain's Station" in the control room --- though in reality that spot on the rear left side was simply the only place one could stand where one could see everything that happened in the space.

Dangling with one arm and smoking with the other, she began another hour's watch uninterrupted by event or report from the crew. The night was getting on and she could feel her eyes drooping even as she stood, which meant it was time for coffee.

She lowered herself gingerly down the ladder into the sonar and navigation compartment. As her head cleared the control-room deck, she habitually scanned the sonar room and noticed Hemi was wearing the sonar headset. She stepped over and tapped him on the shoulder. He looked up at her.

"How can you hear anything with the diesels running?" She asked incredulously. "I thought you were down here to watch the radar?"

Hemi sighed and pulled one of the earpieces back. "I cannot, as you suspect. There is too much noise. I thought if I could filter it I might be able to get a better idea of who the contact is. But it is not working. And they gained another couple of miles on us in the meantime." Hemi pointed to the glowing-and-fading dot on the radar sweep, at just under the 20-nautical-mile range mark.

Hemi replaced the earpiece over his ear and returned his attention to the sonar control panel in front of him. With his eyes closed, his thick brown fingers found the switches and dials of the sonar filters with practiced instinct. Every time he made an adjustment to the sonar's settings the pattern displayed by the conglomeration of thin needles on the sonar's display dials would change subtly. Percy knew that in Hemi's ears the sounds he would be hearing from the sonar would be changing along with the filter adjustments. But from where she stood behind him, there was no sound except the unvarying heavy wash of the diesel engines which swept through all these middle compartments of the boat unrelentingly. That diesel bass-hum would be occupying most of the soundscape in Hemi's ears anyway. No sonar filter was sophisticated enough to do a reasonable job of cutting through all that engine noise. She knew Hemi would keep trying though, because if could pick up even a halfway decent sonar signal he would have a shot at identifying the contact long before it came into visual range.

She considered shutting down the diesel and letting Hemi have a good, clear listen. But if she did that, she might as well dive the boat. And that would mean using up precious batter during the part of the day when they were meant to be charging. Until they knew the pursuers were a genuine threat, it was better to simply try to out-distance them. It was most likely that with time their courses would simply diverge. Hemi was likely being overly cautious.

Still. She appreciated Hemi's caution. The man was a serious professional. They were in a business where taking risks got your killed. Or at least your cargo confiscated.

As was so often the case in submarining, what was called for right now more than anything else was patience. Silence and patience were two qualities that made a top submariner. Though those qualities had to be more than just personality elements. Hemi had a generally quiet demeanor, for example, but when Percy thought of his stealthy qualities it was more about how he never took an action rashly, that is, without considering the acoustic impacts of any action he took --- from the simple quiet care he used when handling tools to bold maneuvers of the whole boat.

Likewise, his patience wasn't just a matter of waiting without complaining. Hemi could *endure* long periods in cold, wet, or dangerous conditions. He wasn't just patient, he could suffer the hard stress of patience without complaint. 

As he was doing right now.

He might be listening to that signal-less, mind-scrambling, interminable noise in the sonar headset for the next many hours. But he would do it without even a second thought to the effort required and discomfort that would go along with it.

Percy wasn't she she was even Hemi's equal when it came to patience.

She lit another cigarillo and placed her hand on Hemi's huge hunched shoulder. She sucked slowly at the tobacco, and her eyes carefully weighted the various signal-strength gauges and dials on the sonar unit trying to read something from these poor visual analogues to the sounds Hemi was hearing. 

But there was nothing there. She exhaled and a long stream of smoke raised up like some post-quake oceanic displacement, and worked its way along the ceiling of the compartment until the sub's ventilation system found it and consumed it.

Time took on the characteristics of the hour hand on a clock. It crept relentlessly forward so that Percy and Hemi, when they considered it, noticed the changing status of their situation. For example: the glowing dot on the radar was measurably closer than it had been. But the hours passed with no distinguishing features to mark them. It was a mental state that was all too common on submarines, and one for which tobacco smoking was a particularly well-adapted pastime.

Captain Percy found herself chain smoking. She smoked her cigarillos slowly, but as the hot coal of one --- with its thin stream of smoke rising up to her nostrils --- burned down enough to start warming her fingertips, she would pull the next from the pack in her chest pocket and place it gently between her lips while holding the smoldering and not-long-for-this-world's forebear to the end of it while drawing air in. A new generation of cigarillo was aflame with its brief and fluorescing life, and Percy would ensure that it slowly and steadily ran the course of its own short life, and made sure it would be ready to pass its flame on to the next generation.

The steady creation of smoke in the cramped space meant the ventilation system had not a chance, even with the hatch above the control room open to the outside air. The compartment was soon filled with a thick haze that did not move or dissipate any faster than their watch on the time.

With nothing in his headphones to cut the grinding never-ending bass of the diesel engines, Hemi had opened his eyes and let them causally wash over the dials and gauges in front of him. He soon realized that his eyes were watering from the smoke in the compartment and from forgetting to blink as the small needles hovered without movement in a cryptic array of silent noise before him.

He took a grease pencil and marked 20-minute increments on the round gauge that was the sonar unit's clock. Every time the hands on the face of the gauge drew even with one of his pencil marks he would do a full 360 degree scan with the sonar, and then point it back at the bearing behind them where the radar indicated the pursuing vessel was located. Then he went through a systematic process of flipping filters on and off to see if he could yet detect the contact on sonar.

But Hemi was soon losing any sense of how many of those 20-minute increments he had passed. It seemed like there may never be anything to hear on sonar. He was beginning to doubt the sonar ever gave anything but unremitting noise to him. Did the unit even work? Did the concept of using underwater microphones for navigation and vessel detection even have any validity? He lived by this technology every day, but sometimes it was hard to believe it was not just some arcane form of magic.

Percy felt a cool breeze tickling the hairs on the back of her neck. A faint breeze, that through the vagaries of air pressure and ventilation system had worked its way down from the vigorous life it had outside, through the inviting open hatch into the control room, and from there in a less-likely feat to stir the air in the sonar compartment deep inside the boat. The little zephyr gave some life to the coal of the cigarillo burning in her hand and it glowed with more effervescence.

The renewed glow of the coal held between her fingers drew Percy's attention. She lifted the cigarillo to her lips and sucked oxygenated accelerant across the coal giving it even more life. She withdrew the smoldering little stick and held it out in front of her, the back of her hand facing up, the coal raised up and smoking down towards her fingers. She studied it for a moment without conscious thought. The coal burned without sound, consuming its fuel and some of the oxygen she otherwise might have put to work in her own lungs. The coal flared up a little in the faint breeze igniting into a brief flame, and then died back to a dull ember. It crawled imperceptibly slowly towards her fingers.

[//]: # (Above graf has got to go, or this time-filling stuff has to be framed better. It moved too quickly into these slow parts, I think. The moved like the hour hand on a clock business is not enough, I think. Maybe it will improved on a full-speed re-read though.)

Percy turned away from the sonar unit and the back of her hand and stepped up to the navigation table behind her. Her hand found the light switch for the navigation table by instinct alone, and the cold pale light cut lines down through the dimness of the compartment to bring the chart laid out on the table into the daylight of the world. She lifted a flat grease pencil from the holder next to the chart and took a straight-edge from the hook it hung on. She laid the tool on the chart and scribbled some nearly illegible numbers onto a piece of scrap paper. Then she laid down a single hash-mark on the glass that covered the chart, extending their marked course across the ocean by precisely that much.

She tapped the uncut end of the pencil against the glass for a moment, but the percussive sound was disconcerting, coming as it did over the top of the drowning drone of the diesel engines. She put the pencil down and flipped the navigation table light off.

Her eyes scanned around the compartment. The forward half, where Hemi sat, was stuffed with equipment. Steel cases were stacked floor-to-ceiling and each case protected innards of delicate electronics. Each case was a particular modular unit that either fed information into another unit, or was studded with switches, knobs, dials, and gauges --- sometimes accompanied by some kind of main display like the radar scope or the sonar range finder. The unit Hemi sat in front of was like that, but there were dozens more in place against the front wall of the compartment.

[//]: # (Clearly, above is not working -- the word cases is not giving the right image of what these look like, and its not clear the look-around-the-compartment thing is working at all. An experiment failed, I think.)

Further back, the equipment got less electronic, but remained technical. The sonar and navigation compartment was the nerve center of the boat after all. The navigation table was surrounded by stacks of rolled charts and lay on top of a stack of flat-files containing more charts. There were other workstations to stand at along the wall, kitted out for various navigation tasks, and for doing the calculations required to keep sharp their sense of where in the world the boat was located.

[//]: # (Regarding next 2 grafs: I had the idea that it might be a good style to ONLY include detailed descriptions of the spaces --- give visual, cinematic life to the room. Here I slipped back into explaining mechanical systems. I'm not sure the style of pure visual description was working at all --- see above note --- but this mechanical-systems description doesn't belong here regardless. It probably doesn't belong in this story at all, since there's no main ballast blow. It MIGHT have a place in the novel...)

The walls were run with rusting and painted-over pipes. At various locations along the pipes were valves that could be turned, either by hand or with a wrench. Most of the boat's physical control systems were routed through this room even though they were generally controlled elsewhere --- the idea being that in an emergency a single person from the control room could manipulate the boat's actions by pure physical force if they were in a desperate situation. The day-to-day operations happened elsewhere, so these particular valves had not been turned in years. Percy was unsure how many of them even could be turned at this point, and hoped she never had to find out.

Toward the read of the compartment, four fat pipes were routed along the wall. Unlike the myriad other pipes of the more minor systems, these were the main ballast blow pipes. Like the smaller pipes, they too had big valves set in them, designed to be turned by a large wrench. But these had been used more recently. Testing minor systems was something Percy didn't feel like they had time for. But testing this main safety system --- the only way back to the surface in a real emergency --- was something that she did enforce. Besides that, they had been in a few scrapes in recent years where a main ballast blow had been necessary.

[//]: # (You should use this story as an opportunity to figure out precisely the style you want to use for the novel. Cinematic, certainly --- but how to achieve that? Lots of visual description? Even in movies it's not like there's an infinite amount of visual description: for a movie its all about CHOOSING how much visuals to use, good movies are often very restrained. And where is the place for similes, metaphors, and more flowery language? And what about emotion --- a good story isn't about visuals, its about emotion. Can you write at least this story so people who maybe dont like the confined space and grit do at least find some kind of beauty in the story --- even if that never happens for the novel, maybe the more art premise of the ticking clocks here could make that happen. Also: the ticking clock conceit at the center of the story --- focus on the aesthetics of that and make sure the rest of the story feels like it fits as a frame around that, aesthetically.)

She turned to the steel ladder that stood in the middle of the compartment and slowly climbed it --- up through the average-human-width-sized hole cut in the deck above that led into the control room. She lifted herself to her feet in the control room and reached above to grab the leather strap. She let the strap take a portion of her weight, the old cracked leather coming to a noose around her small wrist. She reached out her free hand with the smoking cigarillo between her fingers and poked a couple of bony finger-ends into the ribs of Bastian's back. His head had been dropping in a sure sign the man had less than total awareness of the status of the 100-meter vessel he was currently solely responsible for.

"Bastian, you need to keep your skinny ass fucking awake." Percy said to the back of his head. "Don't you rucking realize we are being fucking pursued? How the fuck are you nodding off?"

"Pursuit... at 15 knots. I could run faster than this."

"Not in fucking water you couldn't. And the speed is exactly the fucking problem. We're going flat out, and that blip down there on the radar in front of Hemi is steadily gaining on us."

"They've been fucking gaining on us for hours. When are we going to do something about about?" Asked Bastian. "You give me a fucking action to take, and I'll be wide fucking awake, no fucking doubt."

"As soon as we fucking know anything for sure, we will take fucking action Bastian. Till then, I pay you to stay awake at the wheel regardless of whether there is any action. If you need help, you can go get yourself a cup of coffee from the galley."

"Right Cap." It was the middle of the night and there was certainly no point in arguing with Percy. He unfurled himself from the metal chair of the rudder control station and stood. He put a thin hand-rolled cigarette to his lips and withdrew it again while spitting out a small fluff of tobacco. Replacing the cigarette, he lit it from a match struck against the underside of his seat and left the cigarette hanging from his lip as he lowered his long skinny body down the ladder from the control room.

Percy sighed and sucked at her cigarillo as she scanned over the wall of dials in front of her. None of the small black needs was moving because they were currently maintaining a steady rate in a fixed direction. The depth-under-keel gauge was resting on its 'bottomless' pin.

She couldn't blame Bastian for getting drowsy. There was currently nothing to do in the control room. The only thing moving was on the radar screen in the compartment below and out of sight for the person sitting at the rudder controls. Still, she knew she was not at any risk of falling asleep herself, not until they had some sense of who the vessel following them was, and whether they represented a threat. Perhaps she should take over for Bastian and let him get in his rack for a few hours.

"Where are they now Hemi?" Percy leaned over the hatch down to the sonar compartment and lifted her voice to ensure Hemi heard her question.

"They are about 15 nautical miles off. They are gaining on us at a rate of just about one nautical mile every hour." Hemi called back.

"Are they tracking us on radar?"
"They certainly are. I'm regularly detecting their radar sweep. They are not being shy about their own position."

Percy thought for a minute. "So if you're seeing their radar you have very precise information about their location, heading, and speed?"

"That is correct."

"And they are definitely on our course?"

"Dead on."

Percy knew they had been tracking the contact long enough now that the chances that they just happened to be sharing the same heading were rapidly growing remote. Whoever the other vessel was, they were almost certainly tracking and trying to overtake the *Prospect*. Captain Percy did not like that. Being that the whole point of shipping goods with a cargo submarine was to avoid the attention of other vessels on the ocean, a cargo sub like the *Prospect* had very little chance of interacting with another vessel in what might be described as a 'friendly' way. Particularly if that other vessel was a surface vessel and not another cargo sub.

"OK." Said Percy. "Shut down the radar Hemi. There's no reason we should make this easy for them. Keep trying to pick them up on sonar. Failing that, I'm sure we'll ger a visual on them soon than we would care for."

"I estimate we will be able to see them by dawn." Said Hemi.

Percy stepped up to the panel off to one side that controlled the trim tanks of the boat. She flipped a few switches and opened a valve. Far off in the innards of the *Prospect* she could hear water flowing through pipes. She kept her eye on the depth gauge and watched it rise two meters before she closed the valves to the trim tanks.

"Are we diving Captain Percy?"

She looked up. Owen's head was a dark shadow two decks above her looking down from the bridge of the sail. "No Owen, I would have sounded the alarm if we were diving. I wouldn't have left you up there! No, I wanted to get the deck under water so we make less of a radar target. Get back in the lookout ring and keep a sharp eye out behind us. Hemi estimates we'll be able to see that pursuing contact by morning."

"Right Captain Percy, I will."

With just the sail above water, the *Prospect* could still run on the diesel engines and would be harder to spot on radar. Still, any modern radar unit would likely be good enough to track even the much smaller target of the sail alone. This move was a practical step, but not a permanent solution.

Percy climbed up to the bridge. Nothing had changed above-decks except the main the lookout ring was the much-smaller Owen, and the sound of the water rushing past the boat was much louder and closer now. She looked over the side of the sail and right down into the black liquid cut by white wake rendered a pale gray by the dim star light. With most of the boat underwater, it made it look from her perspective like the small sail she rode atop of was all there was to her vessel. It made her feel small and exposed under that immense dome of stars.

It was also quieter since the engines were now muffled by the meter or so of water covering them. That didn't diminish the bass rumble that escaped from the exhaust plume streaming up from the open pipes behind her, but the more atmospheric bass resonance she was used to when the ran on the surface was gone. It felt peaceful. Or at least peaceful in perspective. Or as peaceful as you could expect when being driven along at a clip by huge engines deriving their power from contained and directed explosions.

Unfortunately, the sound that didn't reach her ears through the air was almost certainly being dispersed through the water instead. Running sail-out might make for a smaller radar target, but they were probably that much easier to track on sonar. There were always trade-offs.

Percy lit another cigarillo and chatted casually with Owen, lifting her voice so he could hear her from the lookout ring. He seemed to be run through with boredom, which made sense since there was nothing to see through the binoculars except for the black line of pitch at the horizon where the dim stars came down to meet the Earth. Percy felt that chatting with Owen would help keep him sharp for a job that was a sure soporific.

But there was only so much to talk about with such little sensory input to spark conversation. It was not long after the glowing butt of her cigarillo had taken off into the wake behind that their conversation dwindled off. Percy lit another and puffed at it slowly, trying to make the smoking consume the time.

She wasn't sure, she may have closed her eyes for a minute. It was an undisciplined thing for a captain to do, but she opened them when the warm glow of her cigarillo burned the back of her fingers.

She tossed the butt out into the pitch, watching the orange glow spark and gain life before going dark, traveling off to some nether-world to find its mate.

After that, it was possible she closed her eyes again.

Owen coughed. "I've got a shadow on the horizon Captain Percy." He was looking intently through the binoculars at the sea behind them.
