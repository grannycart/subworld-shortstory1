You do not think about it much, but submarines are out there. They are out there in the ocean all the time. They swim in the murk, in the blackness, below the part of the sea that light penetrates to. They swim in the subconscious. They are subconscious objects. Things that we never think about, but we know are there. Monsters and fantasies, fears and desires. Submarines are big metal greasy machines, painstakingly engineered to push the very envelope of silence.

There are no windows on a submarine. There's no windows because it feels its way in the darkness. With invisible sensor hands that reach out. And exceptional hearing with which it not only listens, but can feel the shape of the world around it. It has no eyes, but it is not blind. It is rarely seen, but it is always there. A huge black metal monster. It rides below the surface, pushing silently through a frozen black pool of grease and grime.


The sea is a vast greasy pit. Across it roams boats of steel and grime. Oil that burns.


The _Prospect_ cut across the surface of that grease pit, writing its history as it went. From the stacks that emerged from the top of the sail, flames arced up into the sky, and were blown backwards by the breeze they charged into. Black soot climbed up and held in the air, infinite little particles of black that coalesced together and formed into a cloud. The cloud of black marked the path of the passing of the boat, rising up behind it. Unfortunately, it left a signal, a signal that other boats could follow.
