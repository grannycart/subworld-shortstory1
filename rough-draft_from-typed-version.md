# Subworld Short Story #1 -- Rough Draft From As-Typed Version



Contrary to conventional notions, the oceans of our world are in fact vast slow-moving cauldrons of pitch and oil. A viscous and black liquid into which the light of the sun barely seeps, penetrating only enough to create a dim penumbra glow at the very edges if one were taking the totality of the ocean's mass into account when one considered them. Which is how one should consider the oceans. They are not separate basins slowly dribbling back and forth from one to the other, but a single huge mass of greasy black lubricant, malevolently yanked bodily back and forth by the moon twice a day. The oceans are no some porpoise-filled, cycle-of-life-affirming, three-dimensional, Earth-in-its-natural-state playground, they are the greatest force of never-ending darkness in our world. For that reason we rarely think about them. What oceans actually are is literally out-of-sight, and out of mind.

For most of us.

Pushing their way slowly through the thick blackness are thousands and thousands of objects --- steel tubes with no windows that feel their way by sound alone. These objects, at home in the subconscious medium of the black ocean, are also rarely considered or thought about. They are objects that reside in our cultural subconscious, occupying a mostly forgotten space. That is, in fact the intention of the objects --- to be forgotten as they traverse a forgotten medium. To become conscious of them is for their central function to have failed.

These objects --- 'boats' is the term-of-art, but commonly called submarines --- are mechanical objects. They were built by humans, who spend most of their time wandering the sub-baked, dry crusty parts of the planet, and chose to put the very limits of their mechanical skills to the test to create these objects that would allow them to exist and move through a field where every aspect of their delicate life-requirements needed a mechanical intervention. That is, to pass through liquid death.

The boats are forgotten, but there is no home that does not contain many everyday objects that passed through the hold of one of these machines. They enable the trade and logistics that make our culture of things possible.

While in our surface world trade has ground to a near-halt by the never-ending soft-power bickering and dispute, the cargo submarines and their crews have used their clandestine stealth to make trade possible. Like the liquid ocean rolling back and forth, the cargo submarines have created a subconscious flow of their own --- a kind of beneath-the-consciousness global economic commerce.

The *Prospect* was one of these cargo subs. Roughly a hundred meters long and painted black, its forward half was almost entirely an empty void designed to be loaded up with cargo of any type that could be fit into its hold. A short distance back from the bow of this boat sprang short wings from the side --- the planes that could be angled to control whether the machine moved up or down in the water. About two-thirds of the length back on this steel tube, a large black dorsal fin sprouted up --- the sail --- which attained a height of about seven meters. two-thirds again the height of the main tube of the submarine itself. The top of the sail was inset with a shallow well --- the bridge --- from which the boat could be directed while it was running on the surface.

Which is what it was doing right now. The *Prospect* was a diesel-electric boat --- like nearly all civilian cargo subs and Authority war machines at the time of this story. It generally ran on the surface at night, driven by its powerful diesel engines and charging its batteries at the same time. During the day, it would submerge and run down the battery charge as its nearly-silent electric motors pushed it through the oily depths.

While surfaced at night, Captain Percy generally preferred to be on the bridge at the top of the sail, at least if the weather was anything other than awful. On this particular night Percy smoked through one blunt wrap of tobacco after another, elbows resting on the fairing of the sail, facing the rear of the boat. The tobacco smoke rose up and quickly wafted off into the breeze, dispersed and invisible against the gray star-stuffed night sky.

At the rear of the sail, directly in Captain Percy's gaze, two black fingers rose up into the air above. From the tips of those fingers flames of glowing red, that occasionally brightened to a lush orange, arced up into the sky and were blown backwards by the breeze the boat was charging into. Black soot poured off the end of the flames and climbed up and held in the air, infinite little particles of black that coalesced together and formed into a cloud. The cloud of soot marked the bath of the passing boat, rising up behind it. Unfortunately, it left a signal, a path of breadcrumbs, that other vessels could follow. The *Prospect* cut across the oily surface, writing its history as it went.

Up above Captain Percy in the lookout ring, a huge man --- huge in both girth and height --- had wedged himself. He was holding a large pair of binoculars and slowly completing a 360-degree scan of the black line where the horizon of the ocean met the gray of the sky.

"See anything Hemi?" Captain Percy called up to the big man, more to break up the monotony than because any report was actually needed.

"No Sylvia." He replied. "It is one of those nights where the planes of the sea and the sky look like they have been hammered against each other, and there is no space left for even the tiniest mote to squeeze between them."

Percy pulled at her cigarillo and looked up at the dome of stars above her, made impossibly flat by nothing but the sheer and unfathomable distance. Even with no moon, the stars glowed with a brightness that made the whole sky shine with a celestial light that almost stung the eyes when confronted with the inky unreflective blackness of the sea below.

Half an hour passed in an uninterrupted sensory blackwash. The diesels hummed their unvarying groan-drone, the soles of Percy's boots vibrated, the ocean chop sloshed in a regular pattern along the semi-exposed hull of the boat.

Percy let the second half of her cigarillo burn away between her fingers without remembering to take a puff from it. She was beginning to love the ability to tell whether she was standing on the bridge of her boat or just dreaming it when at the bottom of the ladder at her feet a circular hatch split open and a hellish red glow poured out.
