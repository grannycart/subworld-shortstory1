# Subworld Short Story #1 -- Second version, revision #1


A cup of coffee appeared in the empty space before her eyes, suspended by the rim from the tips of thick fingers. The skin on those fingers was dry, and it cracked in places it circles callous. Each crack was lined in black where years of exposure to various greasy substances had worked its way in. 

The cup was made of stamped and rolled metal, the outside coated in a dipped rubber. The rubber coating was also cracked and worn away in places much like the fingers above.

She took the cup and the fingers withdrew from her line of vision. She realized the cup was too hot to be held by anything but the rim or the little handle. She moved it from one hand to the other, holding it by the handle with the ends of her thin fingers, and brought it up to send a pursed-lip cooling breath across the surface. Small chunks of gray creamer that had remained undissolved scattered across the rippling gray liquid. 

She sipped at the coffee. It was too hot to have any taste. She set the cup on the shallow wooden sill in front of her, among the thousands of rings that had preceded this particular cup -- a pattern that was clearly random yet retained a suggestion of intention. She flipped a metal switch powering up the equipment in front of her and slipped the headphones over her ears.

There was a rush of noise -- the microphones were overwhelmed by the sound of the diesel engines that shook the steel walls and penetrated to every corner of the compartment. Her fingertips found the filter switches and volume knobs by rote muscle memory, and she shut down the wash of sound in her ears until the ambient sound in the room from the diesel engines was louder than in her headset. The stack of gauges on the wall in front of her still showed by their quavering needles that the sound detection equipment continued to be overwashed by engine noise. Her eyes scanned the needles for a few seconds, but then silence passed like a wave through the compartment and all the needles dropped down to hover near their zero pins.

The silence was the signal for her to go to work. Her fingertips reversed the settings from a moment ago, and the signal in her headset grew louder as she increased the gain. The sound remained a white-noise hiss, but where the diesel engines had given off a flat and featureless roar, now she could hear an additional spatial quality. The sound expanded around her. She knew from experience that she could hear for miles underwater. And experience had trained her mind to shift into a mode where she understood the particular hiss she now had in her headphones as depth -- a huge expanse of a fat column of water in every direction she pointed her microphones.

The sound also had a direction to it. From the surface above came the unique and subtly varying roll and hiss of the waves, which gave her a sense of "up." And those waves also slid along the hull in a particular way, so her mind knew from the sound alone if the microphones were aimed out to one side or the other of the boat. The bow also created the unique sound of waves cracking and splitting against it. So her ears knew which was was forward as well.

The pads of her fingers rested on the top of the smooth steel curve of the small wheel with its hard little finger-sized bumps molded into it. The wheel controlled the direction the underwater microphones pointed. Outside the boat, the microphones slowly rotated around with the turning of the wheel. She scanned her eyes over the instrumentation -- occasionally the electronic indicators could catch a signal before her ears did. But that was rare. Her primary equipment was the headphones. The sounds that came through transmitted a picture of the surrounding water to her. All the gauges and dials were supplemental to the picture in her head, like an engraved image that accompanied the text of a novel. 

After a couple of passes, she was sure there was nothing nearby but empty water. Now she engaged some of the electronic filters that did a reasonable job of cutting down the frequencies of the sounds that came from the surface chop. This is where the more sophisticated electronics of the sonar rig could occasionally shine -- by filtering out specific frequencies she could focus in on more distant and dimmer sounds. Her ear interpreted the shift in the white-noise hiss of sound as the filters came online as listening further out. Scanning further out meant turning the directional wheel more slowly, since she was covering much greater distances. A careful scan at maximum range could take her ten minutes or more. The biggest challenge was remaining focused on the unchanging sound in her ears. The hovering little signal-strength gauges did help with that by giving her something to look at while searching with her ears. Still, she often closed her eyes and would immerse herself in the slowly-shifting passes of ocean noise. Often it seemed she could feel the long-amplitude heave of the big global swells that passed her by, like giant parents gingerly stepping over small sleeping children in fear of waking them.

She took a sip of her coffee. It barely retained any heat, and now she could taste the caked char of the over-roasted stale coffee grounds spreading like an icing across her tongue, buoyed by the chemical catalyst of the artificial creamer. Those damn metal cups: burn-your-fingers hot when the coffee is first poured, and always cold by the second sip.

With one hand on the directional wheel, she slowly circled the microphones, listening around the boat. Just as she passed to the starboard side of the stern, the slightest extra whir appeared in her headphones. She returned her coffee cup to the sill with its forest of brown rings and curled the fingers of both her hands around grip of the directional wheel.

She closed her eyes and with barely perceptible movements turned back and forth across the bearing where she thought she had heard the whir.

There was nothing. 

And then, maybe there was something. Without opening her eyes she moved a hand to flip some switches that enabled and disabled various frequency gains. The hiss in her headphone changed with the switches: fewer higher frequencies, more rushing low notes. 

As if sensing something, the control room requested a report from her. "Anything on the sonar Cassandra?"

She did not respond. Not responding to a query from the captain might qualify for insubordination on a military vessel, but for a commercial freight hauler, the sonar operator was a position of some authority, since she was the ears -- and the eyes -- of the boat.

The wheel slipped between her fingers. Back and forth, inching across the bearing of the signal. The sound there was just strong enough to register on some of the more sensitive gauges, popping the thin black needle up a few ticks each time the microphones rolled over the sound. She picked up a grease pencil and made a mark on the gauge at the point where the signal was at its greatest strength. To her ears it sounded like some kind of distant music, the hum and thrum of an orchestra heard through marble walls and from down a city block. But she knew what the sound really was: a ship.

She slipped one headphone off an ear and leaned back in her chair to call up through the hatch to the control room. "Captain Percy, I've got a contact."

Hemi -- he of the thick fingers that had delivered the coffee to her -- lowered his meaty body down the steel ladder from the control room and stepped up to the sonar rig. He put the second set of headphones over his ears, and Cassandra turned the directional control wheel back and forth across the bearing of the contact. She pointed to the signal popping up on the indicator gauges. Hemi listened for a minute and then nodded to her. "Alright. Nice work. That signal is barely there. I am sure it is too far off for us to get an accurate distance from the ranging equipment, and too far to see from the lookout ring. But we know what direction to look in. I will speak to Sylvia and see if she wants to re-start the diesels." He climbed the ladder behind Cassandra, and she could hear him having a conversation with Captain Percy in the control room above.

Cassandra returned her attention to her contact. But it was only a minute before she heard the popping whine of compressed air turning over the diesel engines. She winced and yanked the headset off her ears before the diesels fired and washed out all the ambient noise in both the compartment and her headset.

Hemi came back down the ladder, moving with an agility that would be unexpected in a man of his size, except people working on a submarine were never clumsy. He stood at the foot of the ladder, one foot on the lowest rung. "Sylvia wants to run on diesels to try to out-distance that contact. Her plan is to shut down the diesels every twenty minutes or so, and give you a chance to listen on sonar."

"Let her know when we lose the contact? Or if they gain on us?"

"That is right. If we do not lose then, see if you can calculate their heading. It would be useful to know if they maintain the same direction as us, or just happened to wander into your sonar range."

"Alright Hemi."

Hemi disappeared through the hatch up to the control room.

Cassandra hung her headphones on their peg. She leaned back, crossed her arms, and closed her eyes. There was nothing for her to do until the diesels stopped. She tried to let her mind relax. She tried not to hear the penetrating drone of the diesels. But they were loud enough to make her feel like they had swallowed her whole body. Unlike on a surface ship and some other submarines, the *Prospect's* diesels had no direct drive to the propellers. Instead they just acted as huge generators when they were running, charging the boat's batteries and at the same time generating electricity that powered the huge electric motors that did the actual turning of the props. Due to this configuration, the diesels were set to run at one consistent RPM that was most efficient for generating electricity. This meant that no matter how fast or slow the boat was going, no matter if they were plowing through heavy seas or making good time on a smooth surface, there was never any variation in the pitch or intensity of the engine sound. To Cassandra's ears they felt like they were just all-on, all the time when they were running. She found it disconcerting to not be able to associate the motion of the boat with the pitch of the engines. The engine noise was also loud enough to make her sonar rig all but useless. She wished there was a way for the submarine to run on just the electric motors all the time. They were nearly silent when powered by battery.

Since darkness had fallen hours ago, the compartment was lit with the red night lighting. The glow of it penetrated through her closed eyelids. Half-dozing in her chair, she imagined the color of the red lights was somehow an exact visual representation of the unchanging drone of the diesel engines. Like she had been entirely enveloped in some hellscape of noise and light.

The thought floated through her dazed mind that she could ask Captain Percy to switch off the lights. But as the thought came up, Hemi was shaking her shoulder and she sat upright. The diesels died away. It was her turn to work again.

The headset went back on. She immediately turned the microphones to the bearing of the sound she had detected earlier. It was still there. Had it changed? Increased in amplitude? Her ears said maybe, but that was based on a memory of the sound from 20 minutes earlier. If it had gotten stronger, the change was still within the wavering variation of the signal-strength needle, which was not registering any further along the graduated scale than before. With a dull pencil nub she scratched out a note on a piece of scrap paper clipped to the sill with her coffee cup. She put down the signal strength and the bearing, and a few cryptic marks of her own private notation about the quality of the sound and what direction she thought it might be headed in. To be thorough, she swung the microphones in a full 360-degree scan around the submarine to make sure there were no other surprise signals popping up out there in the expanse of water she could hear surrounding her.

"Signal unchanged." She reported upwards to the control room. A moment later the compressed air system hissed and the diesels rolled up to their usual all-engulfing sound. Cassandra returned the sonar headset to its peg and closed her eyes again.

Twenty more minutes passed and she repeated this process. Then another twenty minutes. And another. Each time the signal behind stubbornly refused to change to in any of its characteristics. But the unchanging nature of the sound already told her something. "Signal remains unchanged." She reported. "Therefore they must be on, or close to, our own course."

"And you can't determine range?"

"No. The signal is at the very limits of detectability with sonar. Roughly, that puts the range at something like 12-15 nautical miles." According to the readings off the gauges, the signal had not changed in the last hour she had been tracking it. Every time she dialed in the contact, the signal strength gauge rose and set itself precisely at the height of her black grease pencil mark. But looking over her notation, Cassandra was seeing something suspicious arising in the more subtle qualities of the sound. She took this last minute of silence before the diesels started again to listen deeply to the signal. To her ear it felt like the sound of powerful engines. And it felt like the prop wash was moving away from her, meaning the ship was moving towards her. No serious sonar operator would claim to be able to hear that kind of detail at the distance she was listening at, but Cassandra felt there were both signal qualities that were empirically verifiable -- the stuff detected by the gauges on the wall, the stuff that could be reported to one's captain -- and then there were signal qualities that were understood more intuitively. These were the things that she made her private little marks about.

Her intuition was telling her that this particular signal was following them.

The diesels started again and blew away any further consideration for the time being. It was only a few minutes later when Cassandra heard a mild commotion in the control room above. Captain Percy was shouting questions up to the topside bridge -- presumably to Hemi, or whoever else might be up in the lookout ring above the sail. Since the questions were directed upwards, Cassandra could not make out what was being discussed.

The drone of the diesels was suddenly punctuated by the sound of water rushing through the pipes that lined the walls of the sonar compartment she sat in. Cassandra sensed a sinking motion in the boat. Were they diving? The motion was gradual and slight, like descending a gentle hill on a bicycle -- not a dive then. After a few seconds of flushing in the pipes, she could hear a change in the sound of the water that ran along the hull. Now it was muted and flowing where previously it had been slapping and rushing with a more chaotic energy.

Hemi's large boots preceded him back into the sonar compartment. "The lookouts finally got a shadow of your sonar contact in sight against the horizon. Captain Percy is up on the bridge making observations. She was not pleased with the silhouette: it has a militant shape to it."

"And you lowered the boat to create less of a radar profile?"

"Correct. We are running sail-out now. Though since we are lower in the water, that likely means we lost the visual back over the horizon. The plan is to continue to give you an opportunity to listen every twenty minutes or so."

Cassandra nodded. Lowering the boat would make it more difficult to track on radar while still allowing them to use the diesels which needed to breathe air to run. The diesels provided much more power and higher speeds than running the electric motors on batteries. But being lower also put more of the diesels engine noise underwater. While they might be harder to track on radar, they may in fact be easier to track by sonar now.

The next time the diesels shut down, Cassandra quickly found the contact and could clearly see that the signal had gained strength -- by a small increment, the needle had crept up and hovered just above her grease pencil mark. That meant it had closed some of the distance between them.

"Signal strengthened since last contact." She reported up to the control room. She used a rag hanging from a hook next to the display to wipe off the old grease pencil mark and scraped a new one onto the signal-strength gauge at the point where the needle now stood quivering. "Still too far to estimate range with any precision."

The increased signal strength was unfortunate but not unexpected. If the ship behind was tracking them on radar, then seeing the radar signal weaken or disappear would spur them to close the distance to the point where they lost contact. Cassandra no longer had any doubt that they were being pursued. 

Speed was not the submarine's strong suit. If their pursuers were some kind of official or military vessel, they were going to overrun the submarine eventually. If they must lose these pursuers, other tactics would be required.  But it was likely Captain Percy was hoping to make it to dawn before employing those tactics.

[//]: # (Put in break here?)

For the next four hours it was start and stop with the diesels. Cassandra tracked the two vessels in her head from nothing but the sounds in her ears and the marks in her notes and on her gauges. Each time the diesels stopped, Hemi would slide down the ladder, take her readings and mark down the relative positions of the two vessels on the navigation chart. When Cassandra looked at the chart she was pleased to see that Hemi's marks coincided precisely with what she was holding in her mind's eye. But as the hash marks marched across the chart, one set closed steadily on the other. There was no question that their pursuers were gaining on them.

"This is unproductive Hemi. We can keep the wheels turning at full RPMs, and they can chase us across the open ocean for days. Eventually they will catch us though, don't you think?"

"There is no question. Even when ships had sails a sea chase was often just a matter of physics. Two ships rig for their fastest possible speeds, and the faster ship -- even if just slightly faster -- will eventually win out. It is not like a footrace where there is no telling the endurance of your opponent. In this case it will not even be a matter of days. Look at the arithmetic: if you run out the speed they are gaining on us to its end result, they would catch us before noon tomorrow."

"But that is where we can take advantage of being a submarine -- we have other options we can employ."

"And because of that we will dive sometime in the next hour, I think. I am sure Captain Percy will want to get under before the dawn light comes up."

Cassandra was exhausted. The only sleep she had gotten in the last twenty-four hours was her little naps while the diesels were running. That was not the kind of sleep she needed. As soon as the boat submerged she would lose even those little interstitial breaks. She would be expected to give the sonar her full attention.

Two more more of the twenty-minute cycles passed. During each, Cassandra dutifully reported the shortening distance between the *Prospect* and the following ship. Between listening sessions Hemi came down and told her that the contact had come close enough that from the bridge they could now make out details from the shadow of the superstructure against the horizon. Hemi was certain it was some kind of military enforcer ship -- an armed warship of some kind. Hemi was not often wrong about that kind of thing.

"Would you believe they even turned a spotlight on? Played it out over the water, searching for us. Clearly not concerned about us knowing where they are."

"That's a terrifying thought. It means they know we're unarmed."

"It also means that they do not know precisely where we are -- they may only be tracking us with radar not sonar, and maybe having trouble with that. So as soon as we dive we have a good chance of losing them."

"It also means that they do not know precisely where we are -- they may only be tracking us with radar not sonar, and maybe having trouble with that. So as soon as we dive we have a good chance of losing them."

"The sooner the better then."

As if Captain Percy had been listening to their conversation, word came down to prepare to dive. The diesels died away one final time to leave the blessed quiet behind them. But not total silence. The subtle hum of the electric motors droned on -- still turning the props, but powered by the batteries now.

This was the configuration of the boat that Cassandra was most comfortable with. While running on batteries there was plenty of sonic room for her to listen carefully to the surrounding water. And she knew precisely which filters she liked to apply to drain out the buzzing electric motors from her headset to leave just the swishing and washing sound of the ocean, which she could hear for miles in every direction. At least this was true in every direction except dead astern, where the turning props stirred up enough noise that it clipped off the distance she could hear at more or less the length of the boat.

They had not dived yet though. They were still running on the surface even though they were now powered by the batteries. Apparently Captain Percy was going to make sure everything was in the best order it could be before the boat submerged for the next twelve hours or more while the daylight lasted. This was no emergency dive. They would go down slowly, with deliberation and full control.

But after a few minutes the pipes through the sonar compartment once again were rushing with the sound of thousands of gallons of water passing. This time, without the diesels running, Cassandra could hear the operations of the ship through her headset. She turned the microphones around, listening to the buoyancy and control systems of the boat do their work, making sure everything was happening the way it was supposed to. Mostly this was just a habit to check her hearing acuity. If something went wrong, the system alarms in the control room would probably indicate it before she heard anything amiss. 

She could hear the valves at the top of the buoyancy tanks pop open, and the rush of air escaping above the boat as the water flowed into the tanks from underneath. She adjusted the microphones, and could hear the servos steering the dive planes into a downward setting.

The bottom dropped out from under her and the boat sank.

It was only seconds before she heard the valves above the main buoyancy tanks snap closed again -- achieving neutral buoyancy only required them to be partially full of water -- and the dive plane servos whirred slightly as the boat leveled off at a couple of hundred feet down. For the next few minutes she heard various pumps come on and off and valves opened and closed as Hemi trimmed the boat front to back and side to side by making adjustments to how much water was in the smaller buoyancy tanks that controlled trim.

She focussed her attention on the sounds around the boat rather than the boat itself. The spatial quality she heard around her had changed -- it now felt more three-dimensional. She could hear the surface farther away above her head, and the bottomless hole underneath her. Cassandra set her filters to block the noises the *Prospect* made and circled the microphones around. The water was completely empty. She had lost her contact.

That was impossible though. They were too close to just disappear. They could have stopped their engines, but that didn't seem likely. She called up to the control room. "Captain Percy, I need you to steer a course that puts our following ship off at an angle. I suspect they are dead astern right now, and I've lost them"

"Will do Cassandra."

She could hear Captain Percy giving muffled instructions to the boys who sat at the rudder controls. And a moment later the boat was swinging to port. As the props swung out of the way Cassandra immediately picked up the contact again.

It was much closer now. She eased the directional control wheel back and forth across the signal. The sound described an image in her head: the pursuing ship, as seen from the underside. She could see the two props of the ship spinning. She could see the relatively shallow draft -- it was definitely not some heavy cargo ship displacing a massive amount of water. She could see the bow-wave curled up against both sides of its hull. It was close enough now that she could see the ship's direction -- pointed directly towards her.

"They have increased speed Captain Percy. They are closing much faster now. They are within ten nautical miles."

"And we're moving slower now. Give me a report every five minutes Cassandra."

At the speed the pursuing ship was moving their engines would be making far too much noise to track anything by sonar. Apparently, now that the target they had been tracking with radar had disappeared, they were trying to close the distance as quickly as possible to the last point where they were sure the sub had been. Presumably they would resume their search with sonar when they felt they had a better chance at detection. But the high speed provided the *Prospect* a short window where their pursuers were essentially blind. 

In the headset she could hear the ship on the surface slipping off to her side. She adjusted the directional wheel, keeping the signal strength at its maximum. She had the thought that the ship was turning for some reason. It was a couple of breaths before she reoriented herself and realized that the *Prospect* was turning, not the contact. Captain Percy was taking the opportunity offered to her by their pursuer's temporary blindness to make an evasive maneuver and head her boat off in some presumably random direction from where she had submerged.

The situation between the two vessels had changed significantly from the grinding chase they had been engaged in overnight. The distance between them closed quickly now. Within fifteen minutes the pursuing ship was within five nautical miles. With each passing minute, Cassandra could hear more detail and got a clearer picture of their pursuer's ship -- at least of the bottom side of it. They were equipped with a powerful set of engines, and large props shaped for torque and power without much regard for noise. The left propeller was slightly damaged and bubbled in her headset with cavitation. All hallmarks of a warship, or at least of some kind of official vessel tasked with enforcement. Enforcing... what? That was something the bottom side of the ship could not tell Cassandra, no matter how good the resolution of its sounds got.

The signal grew in intensity. The ranging equipment showed a calculation of within two nautical miles now. Cassandra scratched out a number of notes describing the characteristics of the signal and what those characteristics said about the ship that made them. It was often the case that at some future point notes like that could help identify a questionable signal, or provide a useful reference when it came to choosing maneuvers to elude their pursuers. 

The sound of the ship's engines suddenly faded from her ears leaving just the sound of the washing ocean and the hum of the *Prospect's* motors. Cassandra watched the needle on the signal strength gauge fall until it was hovering with a slight quiver at only one-tenth the intensity it had been indicating moments before.

"Captain Percy, they've slowed dramatically. I estimate they have reduced speed to under five knots." Cassandra's report was followed almost immediately by the dwindling away of the *Prospect's* electric motors in her headset.

Captain Percy's voice filled the sonar compartment, amplified over the submarine's PA as she addressed the whole boat. "Until further notice, keep it fuckin' quiet if you please. I would like to avoid an encounter with any authority figures today. Thank you."

Submerged and hovering without the electric motors running granted Cassandra a perfect quiet. This was an opportunity to do some very deep listening. The props of the ship were spinning with slow waving swishes in her headset. One prop was turning more quickly than the other, generating a slightly higher pitch. She put little hash marks down on the scrap paper on the sill in front of her, carefully tracking the ship's movements. They had begun a slow turn to starboard. That was a good sign, being that it was the opposite direction from the way the *Prospect* had turned. But it was also possible it was just a short jog to enable the ship to listen behind their propellers and make sure they had not directly overshot the target they were looking for.

In a matter of a few minutes her suspicions were confirmed as she could hear the slosh of the bow wake more clearly. The strength of the signal increased. They put themselves right back on their previous course towards the point where the *Prospect* had submerged. Now within two nautical miles.

That was when a pulse of energy escaped from the hull of the ship, which Cassandra almost instinctively felt through the feedback of the sonar equipment more than heard. She yanked the headphones off her head and a second later a loud ping resonated off of, and straight through, the hull of the submarine.

There was a minor commotion up in the control room. They apparently had not expected to be pinged.

Active sonar. That resolved any questions about whether the ship was military or civilian. There was no reason for a civilian ship to be equipped with active sonar. It was a tool only for searching for submerged craft. Something that only a vessel with some kind of enforcement mission would have call for.

Cassandra glanced at the ranging gear. It was lit up with the range and bearing of the source of the ping. It automatically engaged whenever it detected a signal as energetic as an active ping. 

"1.73 nautical miles, bearing 0-2-5." She read off the ranging display, loud enough for the control room to hear. Hemi would probably appreciate the precision. Active sonar had the dual properties of both revealing their own location and also giving them precise information on the location of their pursuers.

It was only moments after the ping that Cassandra heard one of the props on the pursuing ship increasing in pitch. She could hear the water pushing with more force off the angled wing of the ship's rudder. The ship was making a course adjustment. In under a minute she had confirmed its new course as the signal strength increased. The ship had turned away from the spot on the surface where the *Prospect* had submerged to a new course directly towards the *Prospect's* current location underwater. The ping had lit up exactly the spot where they hid.

She reported the ship's new course to the control room. Two seconds later the *Prospect's* electric motors whirred up to a middle pitch that indicated a moderate speed. She felt a mild jolt from the forward acceleration. The contact began a progression across bearings, and Cassandra kept the directional control wheel moving to track it. Captain Percy was turning to a new course to try to keep up evasive maneuvers. The contact soon disappeared directly astern into the noise of the *Prospect's* Propellers. Lost in the wash for a minute, it then came out the far side, the low roll of the ship's engines separating itself from the pulsing white-noise swish of the *Prospect's* two props.

Cassandra yanked the headset off her ears as another ping rang the hull of the *Prospect*.

Evasive maneuvers were going to be useless if there was nothing to restrain their use of active sonar. As if to emphasize that point the pings started to come regularly: every thirty seconds or so. Cassandra now engaged in a nearly continuous battle to protect her hearing. The effort of removing the headphones and replacing them everything thirty seconds with each incoming ping -- a gesture that as a single instance was second nature for her -- began to weigh heavily on her already exhausted attention. Every ping broke her concentration. It was likely the sonar operator on the ship above knew that and a secondary goal of the timing of the pings was to try to make it more difficult for her to maintain a clear vision in her head of the situation on sonar.

The pitch of the *Prospect's* propellers whined a little higher. Captain Percy was putting on more speed. Cassandra estimated by the pitch of the props that they were moving at ten knots or so. If their pursuers also increased speed, their own engine noise would degrade the resolution of the returns from their pings. Active sonar became useless above 15 knots or so. The problem was that the *Prospect* could only maintain 15 knots submerged for an hour or two before completely depleting their batteries, leaving them dead in the water. At ten knots Captain Percy was trying to split the difference on burning up battery power and sneaking away from the penetrating gaze of the pings.

It was only a matter of a couple of minutes and a handful of further pings before their pursuers also put on more speed so as to not let their quarry slip away. With the increased speed the pinging stopped and as soon as it did Cassandra had to resume tracking the moving contact. Captain Percy executed another turn, and, as always, Cassandra lost the contact as it crossed the stern. 

The two vessels again engaged in a struggle of matching capabilities. Cassandra could hear the engines of the following ship rev up as they put on a burst of speed towards the *Prospect*. The sound of their engines was loud enough to overpower anything else she could hear in her headset, even the sound of the *Prospect's* own motors. After ten minutes, their diesels fell back to a pattering churn, and a ping came. The ping was followed by a course-correction to point their bow at the *Prospect's* location and then another driving forward of the engines. They repeated this tactic a number of times.

Cassandra had to carefully maintain her track of the contact -- back and forth from one ear through her head to the other ear -- across a wide range of bearings behind the *Prospect* as Captain Percy sliced out a zigzag course intended to trip up their pursuers. Things were going in the favor of their pursuers. In under an hour they had closed to within a quarter of a nautical mile of the *Prospect*. Being that close, the signal from their running engines was so overwhelming that it drove all of Cassandra's signal gauges up into the far range of their scales.

The next time their engine noise dropped off, Cassandra realized that the *Prospect's* own motor noise had disappeared too. Captain Percy had stopped the *Prospect* and it was hanging suspended in the water column, a couple of hundred feet below the surface. "They're too close Cassandra. Gonna pause for a moment and see what their next move is."

Their next move, unsurprisingly, was a ping. Cassandra anticipated its arrival and popped the headset off once again. The ring of it ricocheted around inside the *Prospect's* hollow hull.

Cassandra slipped the headphones back over her head and set the directional control wheel to track the contact. Their engine noise wound up. They were moving again. More slowly this time, moving into position nearly over the *Prospect's* location.

"Contact moving closer." It was hardly necessary for her to tell Captain Percy this, the sound of the ship's screws had becomes clearly audible through the hull of the submarine without the aid of amplification technology. Cassandra pulled the headphones off again and listened to the whirring sound growing louder. The resolution of the sound was exceptional, as it was transmitted through the dense water and resonated by the steel tube of the *Prospect's* hull. The ship moved slowly closer until the sound of the propellers indicated that it was directly above them. She could hear the gear disengage, and the engine snapped into idle.

Cassandra's peripheral vision was caught by the sudden movement of the signal needles on a rarely-used piece of equipment: the ship-to-ship radio. She flipped the switch that piped the sound from the ship-to-ship into her headset.

*...To the submerged submarine: You are hereby ordered to surface immediately, open your hatches, and prepare for inspection. This order is given under the authority of the Alliance of Northern Empires...*

Cassandra turned her head and called up to the control room. "They're talking to us on the ship-to-ship!" Captain Percy's boots almost immediately appeared on the top of the steel ladder from the control room. The toes of her boots hooked around the side rails and slipped down to land with a flat smack on the deck of the sonar compartment. Hemi followed behind, more carefully and deliberately climbing down the ladder rung under rung.

"Put it on the speaker Cassandra."

Another click of a switch and the transmission from the pursuing ship filled the sonar compartment. Captain Percy's eyes tracked the bouncing signal needle on the ship-to-ship radio unit.

*...tracked you from a port known for contraband logistics. You are suspected of hauling parts that could be utilized as weapons or weapons components by enemies of the Alliance of Northern Empires. If you do not immediately begin surfacing procedures, further measures will be taken against you up to and including the use of deadly force. ...Repeating message...* 

Percy reached over and dialed down the volume on the radio.

"Weapons?" Cassandra asked skeptically, "I thought we were hauling a shipment of wristwatches?"

"Indeed we are." Said Percy. "Un-fucking-fortunately, the destination for the watches is the Independent Island Pact forces... to be distributed to infantry who need them for timing artillery strikes."

"Hardly *weapons* though..."

"Indeed," put in Hemi, "if they thought we had actual weapons in our hold, they likely would have already fired on us instead of requesting we surface."

"Doesn't really matter. We could be hauling blankets and fuckin' bandaids, if they know our delivery is for their enemies in the Island Pact, they'll do everything they can to surface us -- and then they might try to seize the cargo, maybe our whole boat. We'll likely end up in non-combatant detention... where at least we won't be tortured. A fine way to wrap up a career in submarine logistics."

"What can they do to us if we don't surface?"

"Depends on how fucking violently inclined they are and what they are armed with." Said Percy. "Torpedoes, depth bombs -- all manner of hell fire within the margins of possibility for raining down on our delicate little heads. And the fuckers know we are unarmed or they wouldn't have been so free with using that fucking active sonar."

She stretched the mic from the ship-to-ship radio to her lips and keyed the transmit button. "Ship on the surface, this is submerged sub. Acknowledge receipt of transmission. Please be aware: we are an unarmed cargo vessel hauling consumer goods."

*To submerged submarine: you are ordered to surface for inspection of your cargo by the enforcement authority of the Alliance of Northern Empires, whose sovereign waters we have documented your transiting.*

Percy paused, her thumb hanging in the air above the transmit button. "Hemi, start trimming our tanks to make it sound like we're blowing air into them for surfacing." Hemi nodded and climbed the ladder to the control room. Percy depressed the transmit button. "Preparing to surface, please stand by."

Percy reached across Cassandra and put the mic back on its clip. She flipped the switch to disconnect the ship-to-ship unit from the compartment's PA speakers.

"What are we going to do Captain Percy?"

"We're going to do what a submarine does best: hide, and then fucking run. Keep an ear on that ship-to-ship and let me know if they have anything new to say for themselves. And we're going to be going through some maneuvers. Keep a close track on them, and if they do anything fishy, you know where I am."

"Yes Captain Percy." Cassandra settled the headset back over her ears as the captain climbed to the control room.

The hiss of compressed air filled her ears in every direction as she turned the microphones around. The high pitch of the moving air was often accompanied by the much lower-pitched sound of rushing water. That was Hemi pushing water around inside the *Prospect's* trim tanks. The boat gently dipped forward and back like one of those drinking birds as he moved thousands of pounds of ballast water around. The goal was to leave the boat exactly as trim as before he started, but to make it sound to someone listening on sonar as if they were blowing air in the tanks to gain buoyancy for rising to the surface. Cassandra was sure that was a ruse she would never fall for herself -- the accompanying sound of water moving through the boat would tell the careful listener that they were not just blowing in air. Besides, a submarine would have little call for blowing air into the tanks at the depth they were at. In most cases, they would just drive the neutrally-buoyant boat up to the just below the surface, and then blow air in with compressors to fully break above the surface.
