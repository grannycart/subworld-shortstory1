## Initial notes
:notes:
* Make sure there's no reference/explanation of "Authorities."
    * Keep even references to cargo subs to a minimum
    * the story should stand alone without having to expain the world it exists in
    * don't bog a new reader down with explanations of WHY there's watches in the hold, just let it pass by
* For 2nd version rev2 pass:
	* Consider dropping all names? Or all names except Cassandra and Percy?
	* Go through story and see if you can more elegantly massage the dialog -- say, if a character enters, do you need to credit their dialog with a: character said.
	* Check any sentence with a conjunction, and make the sure segments are related. Otherwise, break into separate sentences.
	* (Add these review notes to review notes for book1)
	* Strip it down a minimalist thing?
* 2nd version rev1 notes:
	* Put as much of the action into Cassandra's ears --- and rich descriptions of the sounds --- as possible
		* Avoid talking tactics without describing the sound.
* For second version of story:
	* This could be an opportunity for doing a story that is nothing but what is heard through the sonar. It's all about sound. Fear of what's out there in the darkness. Trying to remain silent
	* it's _all_ from Cassandra's perspective at the sonar station
	* it's a little more stylistic/artier. Maybe do a draft with the style of Gaddis, including emdashes
	* less specificity, more about the _feeling_ of things: Cassandra's feeling of things
	* Maybe for this story write it as if it _is_ real --- just drop the reader into a filthy cargo-sub filled world
		* And out there wandering back and forth in that filth are thousands of cargo submarines, pushing their way through that filth, below the surface, below our consciousness. This is how the world's cargo moves, silent, and away from our attention. (it's true even without submarines! also: for reference there's about 10k cargo ships in the world today.) 
	* _Don't_ have any consideration for whether things are being explained or not --- just have stuff happen
		* (At least as you go through writing the draft; on revisions you can see if things HAVE to be added for things to make sense) 
* ~~You'll probably have to fix the references to exhaust --- diesel subs exhausted below the surface~~
	* see notes in research files 
	* but also see note in book1 todos on how maybe this wouldn't apply to a cargo sub
    * Also modern nuclear subs exhaust their diesel engines from the top of the sail.
* they smuggle a hold full of expensive watches. the watches get wound up with the movement of the boat. while running silent under the authority ship the sonar realizes they can hear the watches. down in the silence of the hold with no engine running, the ticking is clearly audible, like the telltale heart. possibly audible to the authority ship.
* probably should re-read telltale heart to hold a current reference point in my head.
* the watches are a shipment from one of the authority govts to field troops to use for artillery 
* maybe it through sheer chance that many of the watches start ticking in synchronicity.
* what are the Authority ships doing? depth charging them? What the consequence of the ticking watches being heard?
* (See note on Authorities 'pulling over' a sub in main subworld story elements list)
* cover:
* one possibility for a grphic: type up the first couple of pages, then approximate a stack that would hold the whole story;
	* Or just do the whole first full draft as a typed document --- as you planned to do for book 2. No reason not to, I think
	* photograph that for the cover
	* make the title visible: but the title will have to have the word 'submarine' in it so people know what the story is about with no visual cover
	* this will do a nice job of distinguishing it as a 'rougher' 'short story' --- it reads as an opportunity to get at a draft for free of something else maybe


## Second rough layout for plot
:secondplot:
* Start in the sonar (skip radar entirely) -- They stop engines so Cassandra can listen.
* A long slow chase while the contact gains on them (Maybe a slow chase into range?)
	* They don't want to submerge because at submerged speeds they will be overtaken rapidly
	* Something like: the Prospect is running at maximum speed (see notes); the mysterious chasing boat gains on them slightly faster. It takes hours for the vessel to get into a 10nm range where they can see its shadow --- black against the starlit sky --- from the bridge
* Percy lowers the boat to decks-awash to reduce the radar signature -- Cassandra can hear the change in the sonar as she's starting to listen to see if she can hear anything above the noise of the diesels.
* At dawn it is 10nm off, and they can see it. The Prospect crew don't like the looks of it, even though it's mostly still just a shadow on the horizon.
* Percy orders a dive.
* Now Cassandra turns on the sonar equipment, she can hear the ship on the sonar.
* There's a ping. Now they know they are being tracked.
* They make evasive maneuvers.
* But the other ship pursues them with pings. With each ping, the ranging equipment reports the other ship's precise location and distance to Cassandra. (Someone comments: they have no fear of the Prospect)
	* Cassandra feels like there's no escaping that pinging -- it overwhelms her sound environment, and washes out all her equipment.
* It creeps into half-mile range and hits them over the ship-to-ship.
	* It identifies itself as an authority boat, tracking them out of port from another authority
	* It orders them to stop and prepare to be boarded because they are suspected of carrying weapons or weapons components
	* "Weapons components? We're carrying a shipment of wristwatches" "...intended for distribution to infantry for timing artillery strikes"
		* "If they board us they will likely seize the shipment. They might seize the whole boat."
		* (for delivery to an island nation fighting an insurgent war against an oppressive empire?)
	* "How can they even get us to surface?" "Who knows what they might be armed with: torpedoes, depth bombs, some kind of hellfire they can rain down from above on us."
* Percy stalls, tells them they are an unarmed cargo sub, and there's no call for violence. She says she will surface.
* Percy crash-dives the Prospect deep. She points the boat down, gets some speed, and then kills the motors. They drift downward, guided by the bow planes and inertia, steering the rudder to randomly changing direction.
* They slip under the thermocline, and come to a dead stop.
	* Cassandra can hear the change in the water sound quality, and reports it to Percy
	* The pings become confused above them; then stop.
* They wait in silence. (build tension from nothing here)
	* The other ship is listening to passive sonar too
* Randomly, the ticking of the wristwatches come into sync
	* Cassandra, swinging the sonar mics around, suddenly hears it when she lines up with the front of the boat.
	* She describes the ticking in her ears, growing louder.
	* The sound of the ticking came together into loud clicks:
		.
		.
		.
	* Then, like some experimental percussion piece (steve reich, that is) the sound slowly began to fracture:
	  	.
		..
		..
		...
		...
		....
		....
	* Until it was a long string of clicks, like a dolphin makes.
	* And then it grew softer, until the watches were all ticking softly and randomly to themselves.
* They hold on, panicked, until randomness re-asserts itself and the watches de-sync
	* It's about randomness: it clumps together and endangers them, comes apart and they are free. 
* They drift off with a deep-water current until they are out of range of the pursuers.
	* Cassandra can hear the passing current, it sounds like the wind



## First rough layout for plot:
:firstplot:
* [X] Start with a description of the sea as a great black greasy stain on the Earth. A pool of filth and oil that sways back and forth around the world, pulled by the invisible grip of the moon.
* [X] A description of submarines as subconscious objects, out there in the world, below the grease pool surface, never seen, occupying space literally below the surface, below the surface of our consciousness.
* [X] On board the Prospect, they are cruising on the surface. Stacks blowing flame (see rough description)
* [X] On the radar they spot a ship 
* [X] A long slow chase while the contact gains on them (Maybe a slow chase into range?)
	* Something like: the Prospect is running at maximum speed (see notes); the mysterious chasing boat gains on them slightly faster. It takes hours for the vessel to get into a 10nm range where they can see its shadow --- black against the starlit sky --- from the bridge
* [X] Percy lowers the boat to decks-awash to reduce the radar signature
* [X] At dawn it is 10nm off, and they can see it
* [X] some kind of Authority enforcer; a non-wartime destroyer.
	* (Maybe a commercial vessel converted for listening and enforcing.)
	* Perhaps a limited number of armaments for that reason -- they mostly have the power to patrol, and call in more aggressive machines if necessary.
		* It becomes clear that the vessel is trying to gain on them; not just randomly going in the same direction
		* And hours more for the vessel to creep into ship-to-ship range; the whole night basically 
	* Hemi identifies it as a commercial vessel; not a warship; through the glass; but expresses a misgiving
		* "It looks like a civilian vessel, cargo ship probably" "yeah, but no fucking surface cargo ship goes anywhere without the blessing and protection of some fucking Authority." 
* [X] They dive the Prospect, and try to outrun them submerged.
	* (Battery considerations -- they can go faster, but it would run down the battery in an hour. Instead they try to go slow and quietly)
* [X] The pursuing vessel stops engines to listen with sonar; and then turns to follow the Prospect.
	* This is how they finally learn that it is tracking them, and it has listening gear
* [X] It creeps into half-mile range and hits them over the ship-to-ship.
	* It identifies itself as an authority boat, tracking them out of port from another authority
	* It orders them to stop and prepare to be boarded because they are suspected of carrying weapons or weapons components
	* "Weapons components? We're carrying a shipment of wristwatches" "...intended for distribution to infantry for timing artillery strikes"
		* "If they board us they will likely seize the shipment. They might seize the whole boat."
		* (for delivery to an island nation fighting an insurgent war against an oppressive empire?)
* [X] Percy crash-dives the Prospect deep. She points the boat down, gets some speed, and then kills the motors. They drift downward, guided by the bow planes and inertia, steering the rudder to randomly changing direction.
* [X] They slip under the thermocline, and come to a dead stop.
	* Don't even bother addressing the active-sonar question. For the story, it's all about the surface ship _listening_ for them. 
	* (Though if I understand correctly a thermocline CAN reflect even active sonar)
	* If there's no active sonar, you probably don't need to go into any detail about the thermocline.
	* (On the other hand... it's kinda interesting)
* [X] They wait in silence. (build tension from nothing here)
* [X] Randomly, the ticking of the wristwatches come into sync
	* Cassandra, swinging the sonar mics around, suddenly hears it when she lines up with the front of the boat.
	* She describes the ticking in her ears, growing louder.
	* The sound of the ticking came together into loud clicks:
