# Subworld Short Story #1 -- Second version

[//]: # (Think of the story as a sculpture.)

[//]: # (When reviewing: make sure you are staying in Cassandras ears. Dont slip into telling whats happening, describe it via sound.)

A cup of coffee appeared in the empty space before her eyes suspended from thick fingertips by the rim of the cup. The skin on those fingers was dry and cracked around thick callouses, and each crack was lined in black. The cup was made of stamped and rolled metal, the outside coated in a dipped rubber. The rubber coating was also cracked and worn away in places much like the fingers above.

She took the cup and the fingers withdrew from her line of vision. She realized the cup was too hot to be held by anything but the rim or the little handle. She moved it from one hand to the other, gripped it by the handle with the ends of her thin fingers, and brought it up to send a pursed-lip cooling breath across the surface. Small chunks of gray creamer that had remained undissolved scattered across the rippling off-white liquid. 

She sipped at the coffee. It was too hot to have any taste. She set the cup on the shallow wooden sill in front of her, among the thousands of rings that had preceded this particular cup --- a pattern that was clearly random yet retained some kind of intention. She powered up the equipment in front of her and slipped the headphones over her ears.

There was a rush of noise --- the microphones were overwhelmed by the sound of the diesel engines that shook the steel walls and penetrated to every corner of the compartment. Her fingertips found the filter switches and volume knobs rote muscle memory, and she shut down the wash of sound in her ears until the ambient sound in the room from the diesel engines was louder than in her headset. The stack of gauges on the wall in front of her eyes still showed by their quavering needles that the sound detection equipment continued to be overwashed by engine noise. Her eyes scanned the needles for a few seconds, but then silence passed like a wave through the compartment and all the needles dropped down to hover near their zero pins.

The silence was the signal for her to go to work. Her fingertips reversed the settings from a moment ago, and the signal in her headset grew louder as she increased the gain. The sound remained a white-noise hiss, but where the noise of the diesel engines had been flat and featureless, now she could hear an additional spatial quality. The sound expanded around her. She knew from experience that she could hear for miles and miles underwater. And experience had trained her mind to shift into a mode where she understood the particular hiss she now had in her headphones as depth --- miles and miles of a fat column of water in every direction that she pointed her microphones.

The sound also had a direction to it. From the surface above came the unique and subtly varying roll and hiss of the waves, which gave her a sense of "up." And those waves also slid along the hull in a particular way, so her mind knew from the sound alone when the mics were pointed out to one side or the other of the boat. The bow also created the unique sound of waves cracking and splitting against it. So her ears knew which was was forward as well.

The pads of her fingers rested on the top of the smooth steel curve of the small wheel with its hard little finger-bumps molded into it. The wheel controlled the direction the underwater microphones pointed. Outside the boat, the microphones slowly rotated around with the turning wheel. She scanned her eyes over the instrumentation --- occasionally the electronic indicators could catch a signal before her ears did. But that was rare. Her primary equipment was the headphones. The sounds that came through transmitted a picture of the surrounding water to her. All the gauges and dials were supplemental to that picture that was in her head, like an engraved image that accompanied the text of a novel. 

After a couple of passes, she was sure there was nothing nearby but empty water. Now she engaged some of the electronic filters that did a reasonable job of cutting down the frequencies of the sounds that came from the surface chop. This is where the more sophisticated electronics of the sonar rig could occasionally shine --- by filtering out specific frequencies she could focus in on more distant and dimmer sounds. Her ear interpreted the shift in the white-noise hiss of sound as the filters came online as listening further out. Scanning further out meant turning the directional wheel more slowly, since she was covering much greater distances. A careful scan at maximum range could take her ten minutes or more. The biggest challenge was remaining focused on the unchanging sound in her ears. The hovering little signal-strength gauges did help with that by giving her something to look at while scanning with her ears. Still, she often closed her eyes and would immerse herself in the slowly-shifting passes of ocean noise. Often it seemed she could feel the long-amplitude heave of the big global swells that passed her by, like giant parents stepping over small sleeping children with a fear of waking them.

She took a sip of her coffee. It barely retained any heat, and now she could taste the caked char of the over-roasted stale coffee grounds spreading like an icing across her tongue buoyed by the chemical catalyst of the artificial creamer. Those damn metal cups: burn-your-fingers hot when the coffee is first poured, and always cold by the second sip.

With one hand on the directional wheel, she rolled the microphones past the stern. The slightest extra whir in her ears told her to pause for a second as the microphones passed just to the side of their stern. She returned her coffee cup to the sill with its forest of brown rings and curled the fingers of both her hands around grip of the directional wheel.

She closed her eyes and with barely perceptible movements turned back and forth across the bearing where she thought she had heard the distant whir. There was nothing. And then maybe there was something. Without opening her eyes she moved a hand to flip some adjusting switches that enabled and disabled various frequency gains. The hiss in her headphone changed with the switches --- slightly fewer higher frequencies, more rushing low notes.

As if sensing something, the control room requested a report from her. "Anything on the sonar Cassandra?"

"Quiet." An order, not a report. The sonar operator was not in control of the boat, but her job was so critical that she retained the prerogative to give single-word commands that yielded the most ideal conditions in which to operate her rig.

The directional wheel slipped between her fingers. Back and forth, inching across the location of the signal. The sound there was just strong enough to register on some of the more sensitive gauges, popping the thin black needle up a few ticks each time the mics passed over the sound. To her ears it sounded like some kind of distant music, the hum and thrum of an orchestra heard through marble walls and from down a city block. But she knew what the sound really was: a ship.

She slipped one headphone off an ear and leaned back in her chair to call up through the hatch to the control room. "I've got a contact."

Hemi --- he of the thick fingers that had brought her the coffee earlier --- slipped his bulk down the steel ladder and stepped up to the sonar rig. As he put the second set of headphones over his ears, Cassandra rolled the directional control wheel back and forth, and pointed to the signal popping up on the indicator gauges. Hemi listened for a minute and then nodded to her. "Alright. Nice work. That signal is barely there. I am sure it is too far off for us to get an accurate distance from the ranging equipment, and too far to see from the lookout ring. But we know what direction to look in. I will speak to Sylvia and see if she wants to re-start the diesels."

Cassandra nodded and returned her attention to her contact. A minute latter she heard the popping whine of compressed air turning over the diesels. She winced and yanked the headset off her ears before the diesels fired and washed out all the ambient noise in both the compartment and her headset.

Hemi returned and tapped her shoulder. "Sylvia wants to run on diesels to try to out-distance that contact. Her plan is to stop the diesels every twenty minutes or so, and let you have a listen on the sonar."

"Obviously she wants to know if we lose the contact, or if they gain on us."

"Also see if you can calculate their heading. It would be useful to know if they are going in the same direction as us, or just happened to wander into your sonar range."

"Alright Hemi." 

Hemi climbed the ladder back up to the control room.

Cassandra pulled the headphones off her head and hung them on the peg. She leaned back, crossed her arms, and closed her eyes. There was nothing for her to do until the diesels stopped. She tried to let her mind relax. She tried not to hear the penetrating drone of the diesel engines, but they were loud enough that she felt like they had swallowed her whole body. Unlike on a surface ship and some other sub, the diesels on this submarine had no direct drive to the props. Instead they just acted as huge generators when they were running --- at the same time charging the boat's batteries and generating electricity that powered the huge electric motors that turned the props. Due to this configuration, the diesels were set to run at one consistent RPM range that was most efficient for generating electricity. This meant that no matter how fast or slow the boat was going, no matter if they were plowing through heavy seas or making good time on a smooth surface, there was never any variation in the intensity of the diesels. To Cassandra's ears they felt like they were just all-on, all the time when they were running. She found it disconcerting to not be able to associate the motion of the boat with the pitch of the engines. That was on top of the fact that the engine noise was loud enough to make her sonar rig all but useless. She wished there was a way for the submarine to run on its nearly-silent batteries all the time.

[//]: # (Somewhere in here you need to name Cassandras sub as the *Prospect* -- its necessary for telling other elements of the story later, particularly the maneuvering between the two vessels)

Since darkness had fallen hours ago, the compartment was lit up with the red night lighting. The glow of it penetrated through her closed eyelids. Half dozed off in her chair, she imagined the color of the red lights was somehow an exact visual representation of the unceasing and penetrating drone of the diesel engines. Like she had been entirely enveloped in some hellscape of noise and light.

The thought floated through her dazed mind that she could ask Captain Percy to switch on the red lights. But as the thought came up, Hemi was shaking her shoulder and she sat upright. The diesels died away. It was her turn to work again.

The headset went back on. She immediately turned the microphones to the bearing of the sound she had detected earlier. It was still there. Had it changed? Increased in amplitude? Her ears said maybe, but that was based on a memory of the sound from 20 minutes earlier. If it had gotten stronger, the change was still within the wavering variation of the signal-strength needle, which was not registering any further along the graduated scale than before. With a dull pencil nub she scratched out a note on a piece of scrap paper clipped to the sill with her coffee cup. She put down the signal strength and the bearing, and a few cryptic marks of her own private notation about the quality of the sound and what direction she thought it might be headed in. To be thorough, she swung the microphones in a full 360-degree scan to make sure there were no other surprise signals popping up out there in the expanse of water she could hear surrounding her.

"Signal unchanged." She reported upwards to the control room above her. A moment later the compressed air system hissed and the diesels rolled up to their usual all-engulfing sound. Cassandra returned the sonar headset to the peg and closed her eyes again.

Twenty more minutes passed and she repeated this process. Then another twenty minutes. And another. Each time the signal behind stubbornly refused to have much change to its characteristics. But the unchanging nature of the sound already told her something. "Signal remains unchanged." She reported. "Therefore they must be on, or close to, our own course."

"And you can't determine range?"

"No. The signal is at the very limits of detectability with sonar. Roughly, that puts the range at something like 12-15 nautical miles." According to the readings off the gauges, the signal had no change in characteristics in the last hour she had been tracking it. But looking over her notation, Cassandra was concerned by what her instincts were telling her about the subtle qualities of the sound. She took this last minute of silence before the diesels started again to listen deeply to the signal. To her ear it felt like the sound of powerful engines. And it felt like the prop wash was moving away from her, meaning the ship was moving towards her. No serious sonar operator would claim to be able to hear that kind of detail at the distance she was listening at, but Cassandra felt there were both signal qualities that were empirically verifiable --- the stuff detected by the gauges on the wall, the stuff that could be reported to one's captain --- and then there were signal qualities that were understood more instinctively. These were the things that she made her private little marks about.

Her instincts were telling her that this signal was tracking them.

The diesels started again and blew away any further consideration of the signal for the time being. It was only a few minutes later when Cassandra heard a mild commotion in the control room above. Captain Percy was shouting questions up to the topside bridge --- presumably to Hemi, or whoever else might be up in the lookout ring. Since the questions were directed upwards, Cassandra could not make out what was being discussed.

The drone of the diesels was suddenly punctuated by the sound of water rushing through the pipes that lined the walls of the sonar compartment. Cassandra sensed a sinking motion in the boat. Were they diving? The motion gradual and slight --- not a dive then. After a few seconds of flushing in the pipes, she could hear a change in the sound of the water that ran along the hull, now it was muted and flowing where previously it had been slapping and rushing with a more chaotic energy.

Hemi came back down the ladder. "The lookouts finally got a shadow of your sonar contact in sight against the horizon. Captain Percy is up on the bridge making observations. She was not pleased with the profile of your contact: it has a militant shape to it."

"And you lowered the boat to create less of a radar profile?"

"Correct. We are running sail-out now. Though that likely means we lost the visual back over the horizon since we are lower in the water. The plan is to continue to give you an opportunity to listen every twenty minutes or so."

Cassandra nodded. Lowering the boat would make their boat more difficult to track on radar while still allowing them to run at the higher speeds provided by the powerful diesels over the electric motors running on batteries. But it also put more of the diesels engine noise underwater, they may in fact be easier to track on sonar now.

The next time the diesels shut down, Cassandra quickly found the contact and could clearly see that the signal had gained strength --- meaning it had closed some of the distance between them.

"Signal strengthened since last contact." She reported up to the control room. She took a grease pencil and made a mark on the signal-strength gauge at the point where the needle now stood quivering. "Still too far to estimate range with any precision."

The increased signal strength was unfortunate but not unexpected. If the ship behind was tracking them on radar, then seeing the radar signal weaken or disappear would spur them to close the distance to the point where they lost contact. Cassandra no longer had any doubt that they were being pursued. Speed was not the submarine's strong suit. If their pursuers were some kind of official or military vessel, they were going to overrun the submarine eventually. If they must lose these pursuers, other tactics would be required.  But it was likely Captain Percy was hoping to make it to dawn before employing those tactics.

For the next four hours it was start and stop with the diesels. Cassandra tracked the two vessels in her head from nothing but the sounds in her ears and the marks in her notes and on her gauges. 

Each time the diesels stopped, Hemi would slide down the ladder, take her readings and mark down the relative positions of the two vessels on the navigation chart. When Cassandra looked at the chart she was pleased to see the hash marks coincided precisely with what she was holding in her mind's eye. But Hemi's hash marks marched steadily towards each other across the chart. There was no question that their pursuers were gaining on them.

"This is unproductive Hemi. We can keep the wheels turning at full RPMs, and they can chase us across the open ocean for days. Eventually they will catch us though, don't you think?

"There is no question about it. Though it would not be days. Look at the math: if you run out the speed they are gaining on us, they would catch us before noon tomorrow. Even in the days when ships had sails a sea chase was often just a matter of physics. Two ships rig for their fastest possible speeds, and the faster ship --- even if just slightly faster --- will eventually win out. It is not like a footrace where there is no telling the endurance of your opponent."

"But that is where we can take advantage of being a submarine --- we have other options we can employ."

"And because of that we will dive sometime in the next hour, I think." Said Hemi. "I am sure Captain Percy will want to get under before the dawn light comes up."

Cassandra was exhausted. The only sleep she had gotten in the last twenty-four hours was the little naps while the diesels were running. That was not the kind of sleep she needed by any means. As soon as the boat submerged she would lose even those little interstitial breaks. She would be expected to giving the sonar her full attention, without breaks.

Two more more of the twenty-minute cycles passed. During each Cassandra dutifully reported the closing distance of the following ship. Between listening sessions Hemi came down and told her that the contact was close enough that they could make out the shadow of the superstructure against the horizon from the bridge now. Hemi was convinced it was some kind of military enforcer ship. He was sure it was an armed warship of some kind. Hemi was not often wrong about that kind of thing.

"Would you believe they even turned a spotlight on? Played it out over the water, clearly searching for us. Clearly not concerned about us knowing where they are."

"That's a terrifying thought. It means they know we're unarmed."

"It also means that they do not know precisely where we are --- it is likely they are only tracking us via radar, so as soon as we dive we have a good chance of losing them."

"The sooner the better then."

As if Captain Percy had been listening to their conversation, word came down to prepare to dive. The diesels died away one final time to leave the blessed silence behind them. But this time they left behind the more subtle hum of the electric motors --- still turning the props, but powered by the batteries now.

This was the configuration that Cassandra was most comfortable with. While running on batteries there was still plenty of sonic room for her to listen carefully to the water all around them. And she knew precisely which filters she liked to have applied to drain out the buzzing electric motors from her headset and leave behind the swishing and washing sound of just the ocean. At least in every direction except dead astern, where the turning props stirred up enough noise that it clipped off the distance she could hear at just the length of the boat.

The boat hadn't dived yet though. They were still running on the surface even though they were now powered by the batteries. Apparently Captain Percy was going to make sure everything was in the best order it could be before the boat submerged potentially for the next twelve hours of daylight. This was no emergency dive. They would go down slowly, with deliberation and full control.

But after ten minutes or so the pipes in the sonar compartment once again were pressed through with thousands of gallons of water. This time, without the diesels running, Cassandra could hear the operations of the ship through her headset. She turned the directional wheel around listening to the machines do its work, making sure everything was happening the way it was supposed to, mostly to reassure herself. She was sure if something went wrong the system alarms in the control room would indicate it before she heard anything amiss. 

She could hear the valves at the top of the buoyancy tanks pop open, and the rush of air escaping from the top of the boat as the water flowed into the tanks from underneath. She turned the mics and could hear the servos driving the dive planes into a downward setting.

The bottom dropped out from under her and the boat sank.

It was only seconds before she heard the valves above the main buoyancy tanks snap closed again --- neutral buoyancy only required them to be partially full of water --- and the dive plane servos whirred slightly as the boat leveled off at a couple of hundred feet down. For the next few minutes she heard various pumps come on and off and valves open and close as Hemi trimmed the boat front to back and side to side by making adjustments to how much water was in the smaller buoyancy tanks that controlled trim.

She focussed her attention on the sounds around the boat rather than the boat itself. The spatial quality she could hear had changed --- it now felt more three-dimensional. She could hear the surface farther away above her head, and the bottomless hole underneath her. Cassandra set her filters to block boat noises and circled the microphones around. The water was completely empty. She had lost her contact.

That was impossible though. They were too close to disappear. They could have stopped their engines, but that didn't seem likely. She called up to the control room. "Captain Percy, I need you to steer a course that puts our following ship off at an angle. I suspect they are dead astern right now, and I've lost them"

"I'll see what I can do Cassandra."

She could hear Captain Percy giving muffled instructions to the guys who sat at the rudder controls. And a moment later the boat was swinging to port. As the props swung out of the way Cassandra was quickly able to pick up the contact again.

It was much closer now. She eased the directional control wheel back and forth across the contact. The sound described an image in her head --- the pursuing ship, as seen from the underside. She could see the two props of the ship spinning. She could see the relatively shallow draft --- it was definitely not some heavy cargo ship displacing a massive amount of water. She could see the bow-wave curled up against both sides of its hull. It was close enough now that she could see its direction, pointed directly towards her.

"They have increased speed Captain Percy. They are closing much faster now. They are within ten nautical miles."

"And we're moving slower now. Give me a report every five minutes Cassandra."

At the speed the pursuing ship was moving their engines would be making far too much noise to track anything on sonar. Now that the target they had been tracking with radar had disappeared, they were trying to close the distance as quickly as possible to the last point where they were sure the sub had been. Presumably they would resume their search with sonar when they felt they had a better chance at detection. But the high speed provided a short window where their pursuers were essentially blind. 

In the headset she could hear the pursuing ship slipping off to her side. She adjusted the directional wheel, keeping the signal strength at its maximum. For a few breaths she thought the contact was turning for some reason. It was a couple more moments before she reoriented herself and realized that the *Prospect* was turning, not the contact. Captain Percy was taking the opportunity offered to her by their pursuer's temporary blindness to make an evasive maneuver and head her boat off in some presumably random direction from where she had submerged.

The situation between the two vessels had changed significantly from the grinding chase they had been engaged in overnight. The distance closed shockingly fast. Within 15 minutes the pursuing ship was within five nautical miles. With each passing minute, Cassandra could hear more detail and got a clearer picture of their pursuer's ship --- at least of the bottom side of it. They were equipped with a powerful set of engines, and large props shaped for torque and power without much regard for noise. The left propeller was slightly damaged and cavitated somewhat excessively. These were all hallmarks of a warship, or at least of some kind of official vessel tasked with enforcement. Enforcing... what? It was not something the bottom side of the ship could tell Cassandra, no matter how good the resolution of its sounds got.

The signal grew in intensity. The ranging equipment was estimating within two nautical miles now. Cassandra scratched out a number of notes describing the characteristics of the signal and what those characteristics said about the ship that made them. It was often the case that at some future point notes like that could help identify a questionable signal, or provide a useful reference when it came to choosing maneuvers to elude their pursuers. 

Then the engines of the pursuing ship dropped off. Cassandra watched the needle on the signal strength gauge rapidly fall until it was hovering with a slight quiver at only one-tenth the intensity it had been indicating only moments before.

"Captain Percy, they've slowed dramatically. I estimate they have reduced speed to under five knots." Cassandra's report was followed almost immediately by the dwindling away of the *Prospect's* electric motors.

Captain Percy's voice filled the sonar compartment, amplified over the submarine's PA. "Until further notice, keep it quiet if you please. I would like to avoid an encounter with any authority figures today. Thank you."

The extra quiet without the electric motors running gave Cassandra an opportunity to really listen closely to the contact. She put little hash marks down on the scrap paper on the sill in front of her, carefully tracking the ship's movements. They had begun a slow turn to starboard. That was a good sign, being that it was the opposite direction from the way the *Prospect* had turned. But it was also likely that it was just a short jog to enable the ship to listen behind their propellers and make sure they hadn't directly overshot the target they were looking for.

In a matter of a few minutes her suspicions were confirmed as she could hear the propellers coming back towards her, the strength of the signal increasing. They put themselves right back on their previous course towards the point where the *Prospect* had submerged. Now within two nautical miles.

That was when Cassandra heard what she could only describe as a pulse of energy escape from the hull of the ship. She yanked the headphones off her head and a second later a loud ping resonated off of and right through the hull of the submarine.

There was a commotion up in the control room. They had apparently not been expecting to be pinged.

Active sonar. That resolved any questions about whether the ship was military or civilian. There was no reason for a civilian ship to be equipped with active sonar. It was a tool only for searching for submerged craft, something that only a vessel with some kind of enforcement mission would have call for.

Cassandra glanced at the ranging gear. It was lit up with the range and bearing of the source of the ping. It automatically engaged whenever it detected a signal as energetic as an active ping. 

"1.73 nautical miles, bearing 0-2-5." She read off the ranging gear loud enough for the control room to hear. Hemi would probably appreciate the precision. Active sonar had the dual properties of both revealing their location and also giving them precise information on the location of their pursuers.

It was only moments after the ping that Cassandra heard one of the pursuing ship's prop noise increase in pitch. She could hear the water pushing with more force off the wing of the ship's rudder. The ship was turning. In under a minute she had confirmed its new course as the signal strength increased. The ship was turning from a course towards where the *Prospect* had submerged towards their current location. The ping had lit up the *Prospect's* exact location in the water.

"Captain Percy: the ship has adjusted its course directly towards our location."

"Got it, thanks. Keep on them."

Two seconds later the *Prospect's* electric motors whirred up to a pitch indicating a moderate speed and Cassandra felt a mild jolt from the forward acceleration. The contact began a progression across bearings, and Cassandra kept the directional control wheel moving to track it. Captain Percy was turning to a new course following the ping to try to keep their perusers guessing at their location. The contact soon disappeared directly astern into the noise of the *Prospect's* Propellers. The contact remained lost in the wash for a minute, then came out the far side.

Cassandra yanked the headset off her ears and another ping rang the hull of the *Prospect*.

Evasive maneuvers were going to be useless if there was nothing to restrain their use of active sonar. As if to emphasize that point the pings started to come regularly: every thirty seconds or so. Cassandra now engaged in a nearly continuous battle to protect her hearing. The effort of removing the headphones and replacing them everything thirty seconds with each incoming ping --- a gesture that as a single instance was second nature --- began to weigh heavily on her already exhausted attention. Every ping broke her concentration. It was likely the sonar operator on the ship above knew that, and a secondary goal of timing pings was to try to make it more difficult for her to maintain a clear vision in her head of the situation.

The pitch of the *Prospect's* propellers whined a little higher. Captain Percy was putting on a little more speed. Cassandra estimated by the sound of the props that they were moving at ten knots or so now. If their pursuers increased speed their engine noise would degrade the resolution of the returns from their pings. Active sonar became useless above 15 knots or so. The problem was that the *Prospect* could only maintain 15 knots submerged for an hour or two before completely depleting their battery leaving them dead in the water. At ten knots Captain Percy was trying to split the difference on burning up battery power and sneaking away from the penetrating gaze of the pings.

It was only a matter of a couple of minutes and a handful of further pings that their pursuers also put on more speed so as to not let their quarry slip away. With the increased speed the pinging stopped and as soon as it did Cassandra had to resume tracking the moving contact --- losing it as always as it crossed the stern  --- as Captain Percy executed another turn. 

The two vessels again locked into a struggle of nearly-matched capabilities. Cassandra could hear the engines of the following ship rev up as they put on a burst of speed towards the *Prospect*. The sound of their engines was loud enough to overpower anything else she could hear in her headset, even the sound of the *Prospect's* motors. After ten minutes, their diesels would fall back to a pattering churn, and a ping would come. The ping would be followed by a course-correction to point their bows at the *Prospect's* location and then another driving forward of the engines. 

Cassandra had to carefully maintain her track of the contact back and forth across a wide range of bearings behind the *Prospect* as Captain Percy plowed out a zigzag course intended to trip up their pursuers. Things were going in their pursuer's favor though. In under an hour they had closed to within a quarter of a nautical mile of the *Prospect*. Their signal when their engines were running was so overwhelming that it drove all of Cassandra's signal gauges up into the far range of their scales.

The next time their engine noise dropped off, Cassandra realized that the *Prospect's* own motor noise had disappeared too. The *Prospect* had stopped and was hanging suspended in the water column, a couple of hundred feet down.

"I've stopped the boat Cassandra. They're too close. Let's see what their next move is."

Their next move, unsurprisingly, was a ping. Cassandra anticipated its arrival and popped the headset off once again. The ring of it ricocheted around inside the *Prospect's* hollow hull. Cassandra had the thought that if the technology improved in the next few years, active sonar units might gain in resolution to the point where they would be able count the number of people aboard a submarine.

Cassandra slipped the headphones over her head and set the directional control wheel to track the contact. Their engine noise wound up. They were moving again. More slowly this time, moving into position nearly over their location.

"Contact moving closer." It was hardly necessary for her to tell Captain Percy this, the sound of the surface ship's screws was clearly audible through the hull of the *Prospect* without the aid of amplification technology. Cassandra pulled the headphones off again and listened to the whirring sound growing louder. Exceptional sound quality, transmitted through the dense water and resonated by the steel tube of the *Prospect's* hull. The ship moved until the sound of the propellers would indicate that it was located directly above them. She could hear the engine snap into idle.

Cassandra's peripheral vision was caught by the sudden movement of the signal needles on a rarely-used piece of equipment: the ship-to-ship radio. She flipped the switch that piped the sound from the ship-to-ship into her headset.

"...To the submerged submarine: You are hereby ordered to surface immediately, open your hatches, and prepare for inspection. This order is given under the authority of the Alliance of Northern Empires..."

Cassandra turned her head and called up to the control room. "Captain Percy, we're receiving a message on the ship-to-ship." Captain Percy's boots almost immediately appeared on the steel ladder from the control room. The toes of the boots hooked around the side rails and slipped down to land with a smack on the deck of the sonar compartment. Hemi followed behind, more carefully and deliberately climbing down the ladded rung under rung.

"Put it on the speaker Cassandra."

Another click of a switch and the transmission from the pursuing ship filled the sonar compartment.

Captain Percy's eyes tracked the bouncing signal needle on the ship-to-ship radio unit. "...tracked you from a port known for contraband logistics. You are suspected of hauling parts that could be utilized as weapons or weapons components by enemies of the Alliance of Northern Empires. If you do not immediately begin surfacing procedures, further measures will be taken against you up to and including the use of deadly force. ...Repeating message..." Percy reached over and dialed down the volume on the radio.

"Weapons?" Cassandra asked skeptically, "I thought we were hauling a shipment of wristwatches?"

"Indeed we are." Said Percy. "Trouble is, the destination for the watches is the Independent Island Pact forces... for distribution to infantry who need them for timing artillery strikes."

"Hardly *weapons* though..." Said Cassandra.

"Indeed." Said Hemi. "If they thought we had actual weapons in our hold, they likely would have already fired on us instead of requesting we surface."

"Doesn't really matter. We could be hauling blankets and bandaids, if they know our delivery is for their enemies in the Island Pact, they'll do everything they can to surface us --- might try to seize the cargo, maybe our whole boat. We'll likely end up in non-combatant detention... where at least we won't be tortured. A fine way to wrap up a career in submarine logistics."

"What can they do to us if we don't surface?"

"Depends on how fucking violently inclined they are and what they are armed with." Said Percy. "Torpedoes, depth bombs --- all manner of hell fire they could rain down on our delicate little heads. And the fuckers know we are unarmed or they wouldn't have been so free with using the fucking active sonar."

She stretched the mic from the ship-to-ship radio to her lips and keyed the transmit button. "Ship on the surface, this is submerged sub. Acknowledged receipt of transmission. Please be aware: we are an unarmed cargo vessel hauling consumer goods."

"To submerged submarine: you are ordered to surface for inspection of your cargo by the enforcement authority of the Alliance of Northern Empires, whose sovereign waters we have documented your transiting."

Percy paused, her thumb hanging in the air above the transmit button. "Hemi, start trimming our tanks to make it sound like we're blowing air into them to surface." Hemi nodded and started climbed the ladder to the control room. Percy depressed the transmit button. "Preparing to surface, please stand by."

Percy reached across Cassandra and put the mic back on its clip. She flipped the switch to disconnect the ship-to-ship unit from the compartment's PA speakers.

"What are we going to do Captain Percy?"

"We're going to do what a submarine does best Cassandra: hide, and then fucking run. Keep an ear on that ship-to-ship and let me know if they have anything new to say for themselves."

"Sure Captain Percy."

"And we're going to be going through some maneuvers. Keep a close track on them, and let me know if they do anything fishy."

"Yes Captain Percy." Cassandra settled the headset back over her ears as Percy climbed to the control room.

In hear earphones Cassandra could hear the hiss of compressed air in every direction as she turned the mics around. The high pitch of the moving air was often accompanied by the much lower-pitched sound of rushing water. That was Hemi pushing water around inside the *Prospect's* trim tanks. The boat gently dipped forward and back like one of those drinking birds as he moved thousands of pounds of ballast water around. The goal was to leave the boat exactly as trim as before Hemi started, but to make it sound to someone listening on sonar as if they were blowing air in the tanks to gain buoyancy to surface. Cassandra was sure that she would never fall for that ruse --- the accompanying sound of water moving through the boat would tell the careful listener that they weren't just blowing in air. Besides, a submarine would have little call for blowing air into the tanks at the depth they were at. In most cases, they would just drive the neutrally-buoyant boat up to the just below the surface, and then blow air in with compressors running to fully break the surface. But a sonar operator on a surface ship might not be as steeped in the finer points of submarine operation as someone who was submerged daily. Unless they had been trained well at hunting submarines, the sonar operator on the ship above might very well mistake the sounds of lightly blowing tanks for the first moves towards surfacing, buying the *Prospect* a short window of time.

Cassandra could hear Hemi's boat-balancing act play out in the water and air rushing through the pipes that passed near or through the sonar compartment. The sound from the pipes reverberated with the ever-so-slightly delayed sound in the headphones creating the effect in her mind that she was being swallowed up by a spatially monstrous push of air and water. Like she was swamped in the middle of a sea being crushed down upon by a miles-high tempest.

It did not last long though. Hemi only had to blast air a couple of times and then balance the air by returning the water to the tanks it came from. It took a matter of a minute or so before silence passed through the boat, moving in Cassandra's headphones like a wave moving from bow to stern with the last little flush of Hemi's ballast water returning them to a dead-even keel.

The boat hung in the water for just a beat of silent contemplation before the electric motors wound up and hummed at a low pitch, slowly pushing the boat forward. Percy was clearly in no rush to move away. As she had told Cassandra: the plan was to hide first, then run. But how was it possible to hide? Cassandra figured they had exactly the amount of time until the sonar operator on the ship above decided to check their location with another ping. There was no reason for that operator to wait on that: it would likely be a matter of minutes.

Cassandra caught the very short whine of the big servos that controlled the dive planes. That signaled a change in depth: down or up. There was no immediate way to tell from the sound, but she could feel from the angle of the deck that the bow was rising very slightly. So still the ruse. They were indeed very, very slowly climbing towards the surface. The sound of the softly idling diesel engine on the surface above slowly rotated around in her headphones, the *Prospect* was turning as if to come about up to the surface near the point where the ship was stopped. Cassandra kept turning the mics to track it. The idling motor sound was soon nearly directly to the starboard side of Cassandra.

The ping came. Off with the headset, the ringing blast waking Cassandra from a kind of quiet reverie. Even though she knew it was coming it still shook her. It made the scene in her head --- of the ship above, the *Prospect's* speed and course, the surrounding empty water --- quaver and ripple like she had been gazing at a reflected image in a puddle and someone had dropped a pebble in front of her. It took a minute or two after she returned the headsets and had a look around with the microphones for the scene to settle back down again.

Just a second after the ping, she heard the servos of the dive planes softly whir again --- a weak signal hopefully missed by the sonar operator above --- followed almost immediately by the bow dipping deeply down. Cassandra had to brace herself against the sonar unit, wedging her boots into the angle where the steel of the cabinet met the diamond-plate deck. She pressed her small hands flat against the console, against the sharp pull of gravity. Her chipped-paint fingernails splayed out in front of her. The boat was diving. Cassandra waited to hear the flush of water into the forward tanks which typically accompanied a fast dive, but it did not come. It must be that Captain Percy figured the somewhat slower descent of driving down by dive planes alone outweighed the risk of the sonar operator above hearing their big dive tanks flooding and realizing they were not about to surface.

The sound of the contact had stopped rotating around them. Captain Percy had straightened the boat out and stopped turning. Cassandra set the directional control wheel for the microphones at the bearing of the surface ship and then habitually jogged the wheel slightly back and forth, constantly trying to center the strongest part of the signal from their idling engines.

The whine of the *Prospect's* electric motors was slowly increasing in pitch. She followed the rising pitch of the motors both in her headphones and more diffusely as the sound passed through the hull and jumped across the air inside the sonar compartment. The boat was picking up speed. The sonar operator on the surface ship was sure to hear that. The question was how their pursuers interpret an increase in speed. Cassandra imagined how she would read a submarine she was tracking increasing speed if she were on the surface. A lot depended on the demeanor of the commander of the ship. A suspicious commander might see an increase in speed as an escape attempt. A commander that was more trusting --- or more confident in the intimidation of their firepower --- might see it as a typical increase in thrust to gain the surface. Cassandra suspected the latter was more likely. A heavily-armed surface ship normally could expect a cargo sub to surface for inspection since most cargo subs were at least semi-legitimate cargo haulers just trying to avoid interactions with authorities for the pragmatic reason of more quickly completely their deliveries. Once found and contacted, most cargo subs would surface rather than risk being fired upon. It seemed likely that this surface ship's experience in the past favored the assumption that the *Prospect* was on its way up. And it now made complete sense that Hemi had not flooded the express down tanks --- combined with the increased speed that would have been a dead giveaway that the *Prospect* was running. If the only thing the surface ship knew about their movement at the moment was a slowing increasing speed, there was plenty of gray-area remaining to give the impression that the sub was rising.

With the increased thrust the *Prospect* was now gaining depth quickly. Cassandra could hear the idling diesel of the surface ship receding away above and behind her. With every second that passed they were putting more distance between the *Prospect* and the surface ship --- vertical distance. One big advantage submarines had over surface ships --- the primary reason those shipping cargo that would be better off not seeing the inspection lights of authorities chose submarines as their means of transport --- was the capability to move three-dimensionally. The depths offered submarines vastly more space to maneuver in --- enhanced by the fact that many surface ship commanders simply did not have an intuitive understanding of three-dimensional maneuvers. Most surface ship operators conceived of the world as a flat open plane. The submarine commander --- at least the good ones --- knew the world had depth.

Not just depth, but layers too. The surface operators thought of the ocean as a single undifferentiated medium. The sub commander knew the ocean was made up of a complex variety of mediums, changing with temperature, salinity, concentrations of organic creatures, and currents. And --- most importantly to Cassandra --- all of these things could affect the way sound travelled through the medium. There were layers far down in the ocean where a sound could be transmitted thousands of miles, sometimes right around the whole planet. Towards the surface, things were more mixed where the sun warmed the surface and the cold sometimes pressed up from the deep. This mixing created confusion for a sonar operator. And opportunities for the sneaky sub commander.

As the *Prospect* gained depth, Cassandra kept the microphones tracking the surface ship's diesel engine. She soon realized she wasn't listening so much to the engine noise of the ship as she was to the changing shape of its sound as they put more vertical distance between them, and as the makeup of the watery medium the sound was passing through shifted and changed. What had been a pulsing rattle when the *Prospect* was just under the surface became a muted rumble. 

Now came another ping, shaking the air inside the *Prospect's* hull. The ruse ended there. The ping would reveal their exact depth and location to the surface ship, and there would no longer be any question that the *Prospect* was going down, not up.

Almost immediately following the ping --- Captain Percy had certainly been anticipating it --- the sounds of the electric motors at the stern of the boat fell away and left Cassandra swimming in perfect silence. She observed the sounds of the ocean, the ship above, and the hole of the depths below. There was nothing to contaminate her signals now.

Somewhere far forward Cassandra heard valves snap open and a giant bubble of air burped out of the front of the boat. Hemi had decided the time had come to flood the forward tanks to help drive them further down. The bubbling only lasted for a moment before a massive weight of water had flooded up into the forward tanks and the valves shut with a heavy electromagnetic click.

Now the *Prospect* continued to drift downwards under just its forward momentum and the extra weight of the water in the bow tanks. They left behind any sound or signal by which passive systems could track them.

The contact in Cassandra's headset was on the move again. The *Prospect* was executing another turn towards some direction that hopefully the surface ship could not anticipate, and the contact was changing position relative to Cassandra. The spatial quality of the sound of the contact was changing more dramatically now as well. And then an echo rose up from below, reflecting back the soft rumble from above until at one point it sounds uncannily to Cassandra like there were two ships: one above on the surface and one equally far below in the depths somehow.

A moment later and the signal broke up, scattering in a number of different directions, and then was lost to Cassandra's ears. She scanned the microphones around, and managed to find the signal from the ship's diesels again right on the bearing she lost it, but now it was a far weaker signal, like the ship had suddenly jumped to 20 miles off. The signal barely buzzed the dials on the strength gauges.

Cassandra pulled an earpiece off and leaned back. "Captain Percy, I think we passed through a thermocline."

"Looks like it. The exterior water temperature plot is showing a steep drop. What's it sound like now?"

"Greatly reduced in strength, diffuse and scattered."

"With any luck 'diffuse and scattered' is exactly how we'll look to them next time they try to ping us too. Keep at it Cassandra!"

The *Prospect* was still turning, apparently coming all the way around to something like a reverse course. With the signal constantly moving and the ship on the surface floating in a warmer layer of water far above the much colder layer the *Prospect* now moved through, it was getting difficult to keep the mics tracking the signal of the idling diesel engines. Cassandra gripped the steel of the directional control wheel --- still propping herself against the angle of the boat, which was starting to ease back towards level --- and turned it past the contact till the sound of it faded to almost nothing, and then back while watching the signal strength dials for the highest mark the needles could reach as the sound of distant churning cylinders swelled softly in her headset. But until the *Prospect* completed its turn, she would have to continually repeat this process to keep the signal in her ears.

A minute later the signal stopped moving, and Cassandra realized it was because the *Prospect* had used up its reserve of forward momentum. She did a full circle with the microphones to make sure she would not be surprised by anything unexpected in water around them. She could hear water very softly gurgling towards to the front. That would be Hemi pushing the excess water in the forward dive tanks overboard --- with very little pressure from the air system, by the barely hissing sound of it, as he tried to stop the boat from sinking with as little noise as possible. Cassandra hoped he got the *Prospect* neutrally buoyant quickly, by her estimate they must be deep enough to be near the maximum operating depth.

Another rising pulse of energy escaped from the far-off sounding signal as they let loose a ping. This time Cassandra left her headphones on, and closed her eyes as she listened to the chirp splatter against the cold-layer boundary above. The thermocline was bouncing the vast majority of the sound energy of the ping back upwards in random directions. For a split second there was a blurry splash of reverberating noise and Cassandra's receiving equipment made it sound in her ears like the ocean had split open above her until she could hear clear to the open sky. Enough of the ping's energy had permeated the thermocline to reach the *Prospect*, and Cassandra could still hear it straight through the hull, but it had the quality of someone lightly tapping a tuning fork in the next room. She opened her eyes and the ranging equipment showed a confused set of readings to her.

"Captain Percy, if their signal for us is as shaky as ours is of them, I doubt they can track us under this thermocline at all."

"Good. If they lost us, all we have to do is wait them out. And we can stay silent without moving down here for days if we have to."

Often working on sonar made Cassandra feel like she had a super power --- the ability to hear, not just hear but see, through the ocean water for miles and miles in every direction. But that same ability --- when it went on for hours and hours without change or new input made her feel very small in a vast empty space. She did not relish the idea of another 48 hours without sleep tracking a weak signal. 

For the next hour the pings came in more frantically frequent series, sometimes as many as twenty in a minute. But this made it clear that the surface ship had lost the *Prospect* completely, and was desperately searching. Between pings Cassandra could hear the slow roll of their engines and when she dialed in the filters just right she could hear the low swish of their turning props. They began a slow search pattern, circling in a widening spiral from the spot where they had lost contact with the *Prospect*. Because Captain Percy had slipped under the thermocline with the motors stopped the ship above had no hints on where the *Prospect* might lay.

The pings came more slowly and regularly. At one point, as far as Cassandra could tell, the ship was directly overhead, and that was nerve-wracking. But it soon continued on its spiraling course. She was thankful that with the protection the thermocline she did not need to remove her headphones every time a ping passed through her equipment. She reflected that if she were the sonar operator on that ship she would switch to listening with passive microphones only. It was clear that the thermocline was reflecting back the high-energy sound waves of the active pinging sonar equipment. The lower-energy casual sounds of the ship seemed to do a better job of making their way through the thermocline. Her advice to the sonar operator on the ship would be to listen quietly for some kind of incidental sound --- a dropped tool or a tank trim adjustment. But in her opinion sonar operators on surface ships did not have that intuitive sense for how to search out objects in the expanses of deep water. Since submarines relied on their sonar operators as the only sensory input from outside the boat, submarine sonar operators just had a better ability to see the world through sound in the water around the boat. She was unsurprised that this ship was just banging away uselessly with active pings.

As time passed Cassandra relaxed enough that the urge to sleep was coming back over her. She kept her bleary eyes opened and pinned on the gauges in front of her, and regularly did a full-circle look around the boat --- more to keep herself focused than because she expected a surprise guest.

Hours passed like this, the *Prospect* sunk in a profound hovering silence. There was little movement through the boat. Percy had let her rudderman and planesman go to their racks to sleep. They were less likely to make a mistake that generated the kind of noise a passive sonar operator could detect on the ship above if they were asleep in bed than at sitting at the boat's controls with nothing to do. Percy was the only person remaining in the control room.

Cassandra felt like an interred soul. The ocean sounded silent, black, and cold in every direction around her like a dream of death. Far above a demon circled, searching. But the quiet darkness had her mind sliding off of a bright conciousness. She knew she was going to lose herself to sleep if she didn't do something.

Hemi, with his usual uncanny sense of every aspect of every person and machine that contributed to the boat's condition, arrived in the sonar compartment with another cup of coffee for her.

She took it gratefully without a word. He sat down in the seat next to her and put on the spare sonar headset. Hemi was an excellent sonar operator himself --- he had initially trained Cassandra --- so explicitly explaining the situation was unnecessary. Instead Cassandra showed him what was going on by turning the microphone directional control wheel in full circle while Hemi listened, taking in everything just as he had taught her to do.

"Hang on Cassandra... What is that sound... towards the bow, go back a bit."

With two fingers resting on the top of the control wheel she rotated the direction of the underwater mics back until they lined up along the axis of the boat. In hear ears she picked up what Hemi had caught.

"Some kind of regularly clicking..."

"It does not seem to be a new contact though."

"No. Maybe something organic... like a dolphin or something." She breathed in and held her breath, listening deeply to the delicate and remote sound. The fingers of one hand very lightly turned the directional control wheel back and forth across the bearing of the sound trying to find the high point, while the fingertips of her other hand flipped switches to filter out certain frequencies and adjusted dials to bring up the volume on other frequencies. The sound was certainly directly in line with the bow of the boat. It was also extremely faint. She was impressed the Hemi had caught it.

The sound was an array of clicks. She had indeed heard sounds like that from various cetaceans, but those animals emitted very strong sounds that had direction and purpose. They would pass the sound back and forth over whatever object or terrain they wanted information about --- like someone shining the beam of a light into a dark room. This sound had a rapid beat, with an irregular pattern:

.... ...... ...  .... ..... ....... .. .....

And it was not moving. She stopped making adjustments, satisfied that she had isolated the sound to the best of her equipment's ability.

"Hemi, that sound is coming from the boat." She watched his face as he concentrated on the clicks in his headset.

The pattern of the clicks remained irregular, presumably random, but it was slowly shifting:

..... ..... .... ..... .... ...... ....

Hemi lifted his headset from his ears and leaned back to call up to the control room. "Sylvia, you should probably hear this."

Captain Percy slid down the ladder from the control room as Hemi flipped the switch to pipe the sound to the loudspeakers in the sonar compartment. Cassandra kept her headset on, preferring the higher definition of the earpieces to the loudspeakers.

They listened for a few moments. Percy lit a cigarillo and sucked a long drag on it until the coal glowed. "What is that Hemi?"

"I believe it is..."

"I know what it is..." said Cassandra. "It's the wristwatches in the hold, ticking."

"Can't fucking be... there's no way they would be so loud. And they would have wound down in storage."

Hemi was listening intently. "No... Sylvia, I believe Cassandra is correct. The watches may have been wound up by some of the motion of the boat... and improbable as it may be, the ticking is slowly coming into alignment --- a single wristwatch would never be loud enough to be heard, but crates and crates of them --- if they were all ticking precisely at the same rate --- could potentially be heard on the sonar..."

"Could potentially give us the fuck away Hemi! What are the fucking chances? This is some vengeful wrath-out-of-hell level shit. Like the rules of the games, strategy and cunning, don't fucking matter an iota if shit like this is going to happen to us!"

"Randomness often aligns to some kind of order." Said Hemi.

"What do we do?" Cassandra asked.

"Call upon patience and luck." Said Hemi. "Order can arise from randomness, but entropy will re-assert itself eventually."

Cassandra closed her eyes and listened to the ticking. From the position of the passive sonar mics, it sounded like the whole boat was ticking. The beats of the thousands of ticking watches were slowly coming together into a regular rhythm.

.... .. ..... .... 
..... .... ...
... .. ... ...
... ... ...
... .. ..
.. ..
.
.

Cassandra watched the signal strength indicator on the sonar unit. With each pulse, it climbed a little higher. There was some point --- she could hardly guess where --- that it would cross into an amplitude that the sonar operator on the ship above them would be able to hear. In Cassandra's headset the ticking pulsed with an energy that felt like it must be broadcasting through the water for miles. It was a sound that was centered right in the frequency ranges that traversed short distances of oceans well, potentially cutting right through the protection of the thermocline above.

.
.
.
.

She rotated the directional wheel around to target the surface ship. Even with the mics pointed away from the watches in the forward part of the submarine, she could still hear them ticking in the background. The ship's engines on were still rolling along at a low RPM as they continued on their search pattern. She tracked them for a minute until she was sure they had not diverted from the arcing path of their current spiral.

She turned the mics back around to point towards the bow of the submarine.

.

In the old days many submariners and sailors had been devoutly religious. It made sense: in a world of huge external forces, it was helpful to believe that one of those huge forces could be brought over to your side. "But," Cassandra thought to herself, "what kind of irony is it that now we need the forces of chaos to save us? I'm pretty sure no old sailor ever called on their god to impose chaos and disorder on their lives to save them from what appeared to be some kind of incredibly unlikely and potentially divine and wrathful order."

.
.
.
.
..

"I've got a double-beat." Said Cassandra. Very suddenly a discernible second tick appeared in her headphones, inserting itself softly but surely in the gap between the strong slices marked out by the ticks one second apart.

"That is almost certainly the beginning of the end of it..." Said Hemi.

.
..
.
.
..
.
.
...
..
.

The beats slowly incorporated a chaotic rhythm into their pattern. And as each tick asserted its independence, the signal lost power.

..

"The ship on the surface has started their engines again." Said Cassandra. She swung the sonar direction over to the bearing of the engine noise.

"Can you still hear the watches?"

"No. Not at all." Said Hemi.

"Captain Percy..." Cassandra was listening carefully to the headset.

"What? More fucking bad news?"

[//]: # (Obviously this ending needs work)

"No... in fact it seems like we are quite a bit further from the contact than when they stopped their engines... nearly a quarter mile now."

"We must have picked up a strong current in the depth Sylvia." Said Hemi.

"So if we sit tight, we will float right away from those fuckers."

"That seems right." Said Hemi.

"Or, you might say randomness and chaos saved our ass twice in a matter of minutes."

She lit a cigarillo and climbed to the control room. She smoked it down slowly while staring at the unmoving gauges on the wall in front of her."
